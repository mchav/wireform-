{- | RFC 7692 @permessage-deflate@ extension.

This is the standard WebSocket compression extension: each
message's payload is compressed with raw DEFLATE
('Codec.Compression.Zlib' in @-MAX_WBITS@ mode), framed with the
RSV1 bit set on the first frame of the message, with a trailing
@00 00 FF FF@ marker stripped before transmission (RFC 7692
§7.2.1) and re-appended before inflate (§7.2.2).

This module is purely about /the extension/: negotiation
(client offers and server selects with parameter values for
context-takeover and max-window-bits), per-message
'compressMessage' / 'decompressMessage' helpers, and the
'PmdContext' opaque pair of inflate \/ deflate streams.

Wiring into the high-level send \/ receive path lives in
"Network.WebSocket.Connection".

The implementation goes through a small FFI shim
('cbits\/wf_pmd.c') against the system @libz@ — no
@Codec.Compression.Zlib@ lazy-ByteString round-trips on the hot
path.  Persistent 'z_stream' contexts survive across messages so
the deflate dictionary is reused; that's the whole point of
context-takeover.

-- Negotiation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

{- | Negotiated parameters that drive both endpoints once
@permessage-deflate@ is active.

@serverMaxWindowBits@ and @clientMaxWindowBits@ are the RFC 7692
§7.1.2 window-size parameters: they bound the LZ77 sliding window
the /respective side's compressor/ may use.  zlib's actual support
starts at 9; values of 8 on the wire are silently bumped (matches
nginx \/ Chromium).

@serverNoContextTakeover@ and @clientNoContextTakeover@ (RFC 7692
§7.1.1) instruct the respective compressor to reset its state
after every message.  Both extension peers must comply when the
parameter is in the negotiated response — failure to do so
corrupts the next message because zlib refers back to the
previous message's window.
