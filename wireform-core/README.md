Shared SWAR / SIMD-accelerated primitives used by every
[`wireform-*`][wireform] format package.  Format-agnostic; the C
sources live in `cbits/` and the vendored [simde][simde] headers in
`include/simde/`.

### Builder

`Wireform.Builder` is the shared byte builder used by all wireform
format packages. It supports O(1) concatenation, direct `Handle`
output without intermediate `ByteString` allocation, and streaming
transforms (compression, encryption) that process chunks as the
builder produces them.

Based on [fast-builder](https://github.com/takano-akio/fast-builder)
by Takano Akio (public domain).

This package is intentionally small; it exists so the per-format
packages can share the builder engine and the hottest C kernels
(e.g. `validateUtf8SWAR`, `countPackedVarints`, `findByte`) without
duplicating the `__attribute__((target(...)))` / `simde-features.h`
plumbing.
