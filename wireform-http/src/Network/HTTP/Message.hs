{- | Unified request and response records for the wireform HTTP API.

These types are protocol-agnostic: they carry the negotiated
'Version' but the rest of the record looks the same regardless of
whether the underlying wire is HTTP\/1.x or HTTP\/2.

Conversion to and from the version-specific records lives in
"Network.HTTP.Client" / "Network.HTTP.Server"; callers should
generally only need these unified types.
