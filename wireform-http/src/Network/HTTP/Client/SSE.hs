{- | Server-Sent Events (the WHATWG @EventSource@ wire format) for
the wireform HTTP client and server.

The on-wire format is text-based and stream-oriented: lines
terminated by CR, LF, or CRLF; @field: value@ pairs; blank lines
dispatch the accumulated fields as a single event. See
<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html>
for the normative grammar. This module implements that grammar as
an incremental parser that can be fed arbitrary chunk boundaries
(line splits, mid-CRLF, mid-field-name) without losing or
duplicating events.

== Shapes

* 'ServerSentEvent' is a dispatched event — what the spec calls a
  @MessageEvent@: a payload, an optional event type, and the
  @lastEventId@ that was in scope at dispatch time.
* 'SseFrame' adds the two side-channel directives the parser also
  surfaces: 'SseRetry' (the @retry:@ field's reconnection-time
  hint) and 'SseComment' (lines starting with @:@).
* 'SseParser' is the incremental parser state — opaque so the
  carry shape can change.

== Client side

The two consumer popper helpers, 'sseFramePopper' and
'sseEventPopper', adapt a wire-level 'Popper' to a stream of
frames or just dispatched events respectively. They return
'Nothing' on EOF and never re-dispatch.

'withSSE' \/ 'withSSEFrames' are the high-level entrypoints: they
inject the @Accept@ and @Cache-Control@ headers the EventSource
spec calls for, run the request, and hand the caller a
ready-to-drain event popper. The connection lifecycle is bound to
the callback by the underlying 'Transport' — pair with
'Network.HTTP.Client.Streaming.streamedTransport' when you want
connection-per-request lifetime (the recommended posture for SSE).

== Server side

For pushing events from a server handler, 'sseResponseBody' wraps
an event source (any @IO (Maybe ServerSentEvent)@) into the
'BodyStream' that 'Network.HTTP.Message.Response' expects. A
typical handler pairs that with an 'SseChannel' so the worker
threads producing events are decoupled from the HTTP body popper
draining them.

=== Flush semantics

Server-Sent Events is real-time: every event the server emits has
to make it to the wire \"now\", not whenever a buffer happens to
fill. There's no separate @flush@ primitive in this module
(or in the underlying 'BodyStream' \/ 'Body' types) because the
popper contract already gives us that:

* /One popper call returns the bytes for one event./ This is what
  'sseBodyPopper' (and therefore 'sseResponseBody') guarantee — the
  caller's event source is invoked once per popper call, the
  resulting event is rendered, and the bytes are returned as a
  single chunk.
* /One returned chunk becomes one wire frame./ The HTTP\/1.1
  server's 'streamChunked' encoder emits a single chunked-transfer
  chunk per popper call; the HTTP\/2 server emits a single
  @DATA@ frame. Both layers stage the chunk into the send ring
  and the connection's send loop drains it immediately, so each
  event hits the network as soon as its source action returns.

The upshot: if your event source blocks until an event is
available, the HTTP layer will sit idle (no spurious flushes,
no busy-loop); when it returns an event, that one event flushes
on its own. No explicit flush call, no event coalescing.

The 'EventStream' tag plugs SSE into the existing media-type
machinery: callers can decode a one-shot body with
@as \@EventStream \@[ServerSentEvent]@, or encode a list of
events as a server-side response body. For the (vastly more
common) streaming case, use 'withSSE' on the client side and
'sseResponseBody' on the server side.

-- Server-side body
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- $serverBody
-- The body popper expected by 'Network.HTTP.Types.Body.BodyStream' is
-- @IO (Maybe ByteString)@: produce a chunk, or 'Nothing' for EOF.
-- 'sseBodyPopper' adapts an event source — any
-- @IO (Maybe ServerSentEvent)@ — into one of those, materialising
-- exactly one event per popper call so the underlying HTTP encoder
-- emits one wire chunk per event (see the module's \"Flush
-- semantics\" section).
--
-- A typical handler looks like:
--
-- > handler :: Request -> IO Response
-- > handler _req = do
-- >   ch <- newSseChannel 64
-- >   _  <- forkIO (produce ch)         -- producer pushes events
-- >   pure Response
-- >     { responseStatus  = status200
-- >     , responseHeaders = [ (hContentType,  "text/event-stream")
-- >                         , (hCacheControl, "no-store")
-- >                         ]
-- >     , responseBody    = sseResponseBody (awaitSseEvent ch)
-- >     , ...
-- >     }

-- | Adapt an event source into the chunk popper expected by
-- 'Network.HTTP.Types.Body.BodyStream'. Each popper call pulls
-- exactly one event from the source and renders it; the encoder
-- (HTTP\/1.1 chunked or HTTP\/2 DATA) then flushes that single
-- chunk to the wire.

-- Server-side push channel
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- $serverChannel
-- A multi-producer single-consumer event queue with a bounded
-- backlog. Producers push frames with 'sendSseEvent' \/

-- back-pressure: when the queue fills, producers block until the
-- consumer drains a slot, so a slow client can't OOM the producer.
--
-- 'closeSseChannel' is non-blocking and idempotent. The consumer
-- finishes draining whatever is still in the queue and then
-- returns 'Nothing'; subsequent sends are silently dropped. This
-- shape lets a handler signal end-of-stream from any thread
-- without worrying about queue fullness, races with the
-- consumer, or running over the cap.
