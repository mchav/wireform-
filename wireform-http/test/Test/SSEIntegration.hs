-- | End-to-end SSE tests: a real HTTP\/1.1 server using
-- 'sseResponseBody' + 'SseChannel' on one side, the high-level
-- 'withSSE' \/ 'withSSEFrames' client over
-- 'streamedTransport' on the other.
--
-- These exist because the unit + property tests in "Test.SSE" only
-- exercise the parser and the in-process mocks. The whole point of
-- the server-side push API is that one popper call ends up as one
-- chunked-transfer chunk on the wire, gets flushed promptly, and
-- the client's parser dispatches it as a single event — none of
-- which is exercised without a real server, a real socket, and the
-- real HTTP\/1.1 chunked encoder \/ decoder in between.

-- | Same basic SSE round-trip as 'basicRoundTrip', but over h2c
-- (HTTP\/2 cleartext with prior knowledge). The SSE pipeline
-- doesn't care which version is on the wire — events flow
-- through 'Body' chunks the same way regardless of whether the
-- HTTP layer encodes them as chunked-transfer or DATA frames —
-- but this is the proof point that the high-level SSE API is
-- in fact version-agnostic.

-- through the consumer.
