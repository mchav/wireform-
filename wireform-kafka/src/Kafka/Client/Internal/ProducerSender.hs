Module      : Kafka.Client.Internal.ProducerSender
Description : Producer background sender thread with retry logic
Copyright   : (c) 2025
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : kafka-native

This module implements the background sender thread for the Kafka producer.

The sender thread:
- Continuously drains ready batches from the accumulator
- Groups batches by broker
- Sends ProduceRequests to each broker
- Handles retries with exponential backoff
- Tracks in-flight requests
- Updates batch states and notifies waiting threads

Design patterns:
- Dedicated sender thread per producer (similar to Java Kafka client)
- In-flight request tracking with correlation IDs
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Graceful shutdown support

-- | Per-broker pipelined-send state.
--
-- The sender holds one 'BrokerPipe' per (broker, connection)
-- pair. Each pipe owns:
--
--   * A dedicated 'Connection' (separate from
--     'producerConnManager' so the pipelined writer doesn't race
--     against the on-demand metadata refresh path that uses the
--     shared cache).
--
--   * A bounded outbox 'TBQueue OutboundProduce' that the sender
--     main loop pushes encoded ProduceRequests into; the bound
--     equals 'producerMaxInFlight' so the producer-side back-
--     pressures naturally without an extra semaphore.
--
--   * An unbounded in-flight FIFO 'TBQueue PendingProduce'
--     coordinating writer → reader hand-off. Kafka guarantees
--     responses come back in request order on a given
--     connection, so a FIFO is sufficient (no correlation-ID
--     map needed).
--
--   * A single writer 'Async' that pulls outbox items, frames
--     and writes the bytes, and pushes the matching pending
--     entry onto the in-flight FIFO.
--
--   * A single reader 'Async' that reads framed responses,
--     pulls the head of the in-flight FIFO, parses the body, and
--     dispatches per-batch callbacks via 'processProduceResponse'.
--
-- Together the writer + reader unlock pipelining: the producer
-- can stream up to 'senderMaxInFlight' ProduceRequests onto the
-- wire before any of their responses come back. Without
-- pipelining the sender pays a full broker round-trip per
-- ProduceRequest; with pipelining it pays one round-trip per
-- 'senderMaxInFlight' requests, which is what librdkafka and
-- the JVM client do via @max.in.flight.requests.per.connection@.
-- | Pool of 'BrokerPipe's targeting one broker. The sender
-- round-robins outbound work across the pipes; each pipe owns
-- its own TCP socket + writer + reader so multiple
-- ProduceRequests can be in flight on different sockets in
-- parallel. This breaks the single-writer bottleneck a single
-- per-broker pipe imposes, which is the main thing keeping us
-- below librdkafka's per-broker throughput on small-record
-- workloads.

    --   benchmarks frequently bump it; the JVM client does not
    --   expose this knob (always 1).
  , senderBrokerPipes :: !(IORef (HashMap Conn.BrokerAddress BrokerPool))
    -- ^ Per-broker pool of pipelined-send pipes. Lazily
    --   populated on first send to a broker. Each pipe in the

  , senderRoundRobin :: !(IORef Int)

    --   transaction on every Produce request.
  , senderLogger :: !Logger
    -- ^ Structured logger callback; invoked on retriable / fatal
    --   produce errors. Defaults to 'defaultLogger'.
  , senderVersionCache :: !AV.ApiVersionCache
    -- ^ Per-broker negotiated API version cache. Populated on
    --   first contact with each leader broker via
    --   'VN.ensureVersionsNegotiated' so the Produce-version
    --   selection ('VN.pickApiVersion') matches what the broker
    --   actually accepts (rather than the hardcoded v3 the
    --   sender used to emit unconditionally).
  , senderTransactionalId :: !(IORef (Maybe Text))
    -- ^ Transactional id the producer is bound to.
    --
    --   Tier 3 of the STM-replacement work: single-writer (the
    --   producer's @bindTransaction@ path) / single-reader (the
    --   sender thread on every produce); 'IORef' is sufficient.
    --
    -- For transactional sends ('attrIsTransactional == True' on
    -- the batch) the broker requires the @transactionalId@
    -- field on the ProduceRequest envelope to match the txn id
    -- the producer's records claim. Sending @Null@ here makes
    -- the broker reject the produce with
    -- @TRANSACTIONAL_ID_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED@ (53) — the
    -- broker's authorization gate runs before the no-auth
    -- shortcut, and a null transactionalId on a transactional
    -- ProduceRequest is, definitionally, unauthorised.
    --
    -- 'Nothing' for non-transactional / idempotent-only
    -- producers; written by 'Producer.bindTransaction' when a
    -- 'Transaction' is bound. The sender reads this TVar each
    -- send and folds it into the request, so a producer that
    -- /unbinds/ a transaction mid-flight stops attaching the
    -- id from the next send onwards.
