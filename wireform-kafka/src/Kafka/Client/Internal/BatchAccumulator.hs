Module      : Kafka.Client.Internal.BatchAccumulator
Description : Producer batch accumulation and management

Maintainer  : kafka-native

This module implements the batch accumulator for the Kafka producer.

The batch accumulator:
- Maintains one queue per topic-partition
- Accumulates records into batches
- Makes batches "ready" based on size or linger time
- Preserves ordering within each partition
- Allows concurrent access from multiple threads

Design follows patterns from Java Kafka client and librdkafka:
- Per-partition Deques hold batches
- Current batch per partition is being filled
- Batches become ready when full or linger time expires
- Sender thread(s) drain ready batches

--
-- Why a sum and not a function-only type:
-- the perf-critical code paths ('sendMessageDropUnsafe',
-- 'sendMessageDropFastest', 'sendMessagesDrop') pass the no-op
-- callback. With a function-only type the sender would still
-- have to /allocate/ and /strictly construct/ the per-record
-- 'BatchAck' (UNPACK'd strict fields → all evaluated at
-- construction) and then immediately throw it away. Tagging the

--
-- Per-partition usage is single-producer (the user thread that

-- sender thread that calls 'drainReadyBatches'). The two refs were
-- 'TVar' pre-Tier-2 of the STM-replacement work; the 'atomically'
-- block on every 'appendRecordStamped' was paying STM commit
-- overhead (~150–200 ns/record at the bench) for an SPSC swap.
-- 'IORef' + 'atomicModifyIORef\'' provides the same single-ref
-- visibility guarantees, with the multi-thread-on-one-partition
-- safety 'atomicModifyIORef\'' still gives us. See
-- @docs/STM_REPLACEMENT_SPEC.md@ Tier 2 for the full analysis.

-- | Hot mutable state of an in-progress batch. Held under a
-- single 'IORef' so the per-record append is one CAS that
-- updates the entire state atomically.
--
-- Records and callbacks are accumulated in /reversed/ singly-
-- linked lists so the per-record append is one ':' cons (one
-- cell allocation per record per list) rather than one 'Seq'
-- snoc. The 'snapshotBatch' helper reverses and converts to the
-- @Seq@ shape the rest of the producer expects; the O(n)
-- reverse runs once per sealed batch and is negligible compared
-- to the per-record win.
--
-- /Seal interlock/: the seal bit is packed into the sign of
-- 'bhSizeRaw' — non-negative is "open, accumulated size = N",
-- 'sealedSentinel' (a fixed negative value) is "sealed". Packing
-- the bit instead of carrying a separate @!Bool@ field keeps
-- 'BatchHotState' at three pointer-sized slots, so the per-CAS
-- struct rebuild on the append hot path stays at the same
-- allocation footprint as the pre-fix shape.
--
-- The append CAS reads @bhSizeRaw@ as part of every
-- 'atomicModifyIORef\'' on this 'IORef' and bails to the slow
-- path if it's negative; the sealer flips it inside its own
-- 'atomicModifyIORef\'' that simultaneously captures the final
-- state for the snapshot. Because both sides contend on the
-- /same/ 'IORef', the CAS protocol is total: any append whose
-- CAS lands /before/ the seal CAS is incorporated into the
-- snapshot; any append whose CAS lands /after/ the seal CAS
-- sees the negative sentinel and routes itself to a fresh
-- batch via 'slowAppendIO'. There is no window in which a
-- successful append can be silently dropped.

--
-- 'accumulatorClosed' stays a 'TVar' (Tier 1's recommendation:

-- slightly, but the late-append outcome is identical to the

-- queue that nobody is draining, exactly as a stray late append
-- under STM would (the sender thread has been told to stop). See

-- /unsound/: the sender thread (which is /not/ a producer
-- thread) runs 'drainReadyBatches' \/ 'sealCurrent' concurrently

-- the about-to-be-written record entirely. 'appendRecordStamped'
-- now uses the seal-race-safe CAS protocol, and this function
-- is just an alias so existing call sites keep building.
--
-- The single-producer-per-partition contract is still useful for
