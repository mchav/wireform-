Module      : Kafka.Client.Internal.Subscribe
Description : End-to-end consumer-group subscribe flow

Wires together the protocol primitives in
"Kafka.Client.Internal.ConsumerGroup" plus offset / metadata
machinery to implement the full @subscribe@ lifecycle for a
consumer group:

  1. FindCoordinator — pick the broker that manages this group.
  2. JoinGroup       — register as a member; one member is elected leader.
  3. Assignment      — leader runs the assignment strategy across the
                       members' subscriptions and broker metadata. Right
                       now we ship the @range@ assignor only (the
                       canonical default in the JVM client).
  4. SyncGroup       — broadcast assignments (leader) or receive our
                       own (follower).
  5. OffsetFetch     — for each assigned partition, pick the resume
                       point: committed offset if one exists, otherwise
                       fall back to the consumer's @auto.offset.reset@
                       policy (earliest \/ latest).

The state mutations land in the @Consumer@'s 'StmMap.Map' assignment
table, so 'Kafka.Client.Consumer.poll' picks them up immediately.

{- | Which partition-assignment strategy a consumer should advertise to
the group coordinator. The assignor that wins the protocol
negotiation is the one every member of the group has in common; the
broker picks one and the elected /leader/ then runs that assignor
locally to compute the per-member assignments.

We support all three of the JVM client's defaults:

  * 'AssignorRange'      - same as the JVM "range" default. Sort
                           consumers + partitions, give each consumer
                           a contiguous slice of partitions per topic.
                           Good when the consumer count divides the
                           partition count evenly.
  * 'AssignorRoundRobin' - JVM "roundrobin". Sort all
                           (topic, partition) pairs and consumers,
                           then assign one partition per consumer in
                           round-robin order until the supply is
                           exhausted. Better balance than range when
                           consumers subscribe to different topic
                           sets.
  * 'AssignorSticky'     - JVM "sticky". Tries to (a) balance the
                           count per consumer and (b) preserve the
                           previous generation's assignment so few
                           partitions move. Without previous-gen
                           state our impl degrades to a balanced
                           round-robin; with previous state passed
                           in, it preserves it greedily.
