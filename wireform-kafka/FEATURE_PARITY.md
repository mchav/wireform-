# Feature Parity Spec

This document is the running plan for bringing `wireform-kafka` (core
client) and `wireform-kafka-streams` (Streams DSL + runtime) to
production-grade parity with the upstream references:

| Library                     | Reference target            | Tracked version |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| `wireform-kafka`            | Apache Kafka client wire    | Kafka 4.0       |
| `wireform-kafka` (UX side)  | `librdkafka`                | 2.x             |
| `wireform-kafka-streams`    | Apache Kafka Streams (Java) | Kafka 4.0       |

The spec is intentionally bias-toward-test: every "Done" item below has at
least one targeted test (unit, property, or against the in-process mock
broker); every "Outstanding" item lists the test surface that has to land
with the implementation.

---

## 1. Goals & non-goals

### Goals

1. **Wire compatibility** — a real Kafka 4.0 broker can speak to our
   client, and a real Kafka 4.0 client can speak to our streams
   implementation, end-to-end without the other side noticing it isn't
   talking to a Java peer.
2. **Semantic compatibility** — the public API behaves the way the JVM
   client / Streams library does for the same input. Especially:
   exactly-once-V2, sticky / cooperative-sticky rebalancing, transactional
   offset commit, suppress (KIP-328), versioned stores (KIP-889/KIP-960).
3. **Operational compatibility** — every `librdkafka` knob that maps to
   client behaviour has a corresponding `wireform-kafka` config field
   with the same name, default, and semantics. See
   [`CONFIG_PARITY.md`](./CONFIG_PARITY.md).
4. **Testability** — an in-process `MockCluster` covers every failure
   mode that `librdkafka`'s mock-cluster suite exercises, so we can land
   regressions with deterministic tests.

### Non-goals

- Bug-for-bug compatibility with quirks the JVM client itself documents
  as deprecated.
- The pre-KIP-848 ZooKeeper coordinator path. KRaft only.
- Compatibility with brokers older than Kafka 2.5 (we negotiate down via
  `ApiVersions` to the lowest version we still implement, not arbitrarily
  far back).
- Schema-Registry-the-product (Confluent's HTTP service). We will ship
  the *client-side* Avro / JSON-Schema / Protobuf serdes interfaces, but
  spinning up a registry is out of scope.

---

## 2. Done — current state inventory

### 2.1 `wireform-kafka` (core client)

#### Wire protocol

- API key coverage: Produce, Fetch, ListOffsets, Metadata, OffsetCommit,
  OffsetFetch, FindCoordinator, JoinGroup, SyncGroup, Heartbeat,
  LeaveGroup, DescribeGroups, ListGroups, DeleteGroups, CreateTopics,
  DeleteTopics, ApiVersions, InitProducerId, AddPartitionsToTxn,
  AddOffsetsToTxn, EndTxn, TxnOffsetCommit, DescribeConfigs, AlterConfigs.
- Versioned (incl. flexible / tagged-fields) request/response
  encoders + decoders, generated from the Kafka schema. Comprehensive
  round-trip property tests (`test/Protocol/Generated/ComprehensiveSpec.hs`).
- Record batch v2 (KIP-98), variable-length records, headers,
  CRC32-C, idempotent producer sequencing, transactional records.
- Compression: gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd. Per-batch + per-record codecs,
  property-tested.

#### Client behaviour

- `Producer`:
  - Idempotent producer (KIP-98) with per-partition sequence numbers.
  - `BatchAccumulator` with linger.ms, batch.size, sticky-partitioning
    (KIP-480 inspired), per-batch retry counter + exponential backoff
    with jitter, structured `Logger` callback for sender errors.
  - Transaction *coordination protocol* (`Kafka.Client.Transaction`):
    `initTransactions`, `beginTransaction`, `sendOffsetsToTransaction`,
    `commitTransaction`, `abortTransaction`. State machine, coordinator
    discovery, `InitProducerId`, `AddPartitionsToTxn`,
    `AddOffsetsToTxn`, `TxnOffsetCommit`, `EndTxn` are wired against
    the `TransactionCoordinator`. Per-stamp `(TxnId, Epoch)`
    visibility tracking in the mock means aborted records *stay*
    aborted across epoch reuse.
  - `bindTransaction :: Producer -> Transaction -> IO ()` attaches
    a `Transaction` to a `Producer`. Once bound:
      - `sendMessage` rejects with a typed-string error unless the
        transaction is in `InTransaction` (gate logic exposed
        publicly as `producerTxnGate` for testing);
      - the first send on a (topic, partition) inside the open
        transaction issues `AddPartitionsToTxn` to the coordinator
        (memoised per-txn so subsequent sends are STM-only);
      - outgoing record batches are stamped with the transactional
        producer-id / epoch / sequence (allocated via
        `appendRecordStamped` + `BatchStamp` on the
        accumulator) and the `attrIsTransactional` bit is flipped
        on the wire-level `Attributes` word;
      - `closeProducer` aborts an open transaction before shutdown
        so the broker doesn't keep the txn id locked for
        `transaction.timeout.ms`.
    What's still pending: the end-to-end live-broker test, plus the
    Streams runtime hooking the engine's commit ticks into the
    bound producer's `beginTransaction` /
    `sendOffsetsToTransaction` / `commitTransaction` cycle (S0
    "Full `KafkaStreams` runtime against the real client" in §3.2).
- `Consumer`:
  - `subscribeFlow` with FindCoordinator → JoinGroup → SyncGroup →
    OffsetFetch.
  - Range / round-robin / sticky / cooperative-sticky assignors. Sticky
    consumes previous-generation `ownedPartitions` (consumer-protocol
    v1, KIP-341/KIP-429); fixed in this branch.
  - Per-partition pause/resume, manual offset store, isolation level
    (read-committed / read-uncommitted), commit-with-metadata.
  - LeaveGroup RPC on close (no more silent-timeout-out members).
  - Heartbeat thread.
- `AdminClient`:
  - createTopics / deleteTopics / listTopics / describeTopics /
    listConsumerGroups / describeConsumerGroups / deleteConsumerGroups /
    describeConfigs.
  - DescribeConfigs decodes KIP-226 `ConfigSource` correctly to
    distinguish DEFAULT_CONFIG from any override; the unwrap helpers are
    public + unit-tested.
- `TransactionCoordinator`:
  - findCoordinator, initProducerId, addPartitionsToTxn, endTransaction,
    addOffsetsToTxn, txnOffsetCommitWith. Pure request builders are
    public + tested.
- `Pipeline`:
  - Send / receive / timeout threads, correlation-id routing into
    caller-held `TMVar` slots, in-flight + queue-size backpressure,
    statistics counters, clean shutdown. Tested against a localhost echo
    broker.

#### Networking

- `Network.Connection`:
  - Per-broker connection pool (`ConnectionManager`).
  - DNS resolution modes (host / `use_all_dns_ips` /
    `resolve_canonical_bootstrap_servers_only` per KIP-235), broker
    address family selection (any / v4 / v6).
  - Socket buffer / Nagle / keepalive / max-idle / max-fails knobs.
  - Best-effort `isConnected` liveness probe (alive-idle case fixed in
    this branch).
- API version negotiation:
  - `ApiVersionsRequest` on connect, `ApiVersionCache` per broker,
    `selectVersion` picks the highest version both sides understand.
- SASL:
  - PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512, OAUTHBEARER, AWS_MSK_IAM,
    GSSAPI handshakes. `wireName` round-trips.

#### Mock broker

- `Kafka.Client.Mock.*`:
  - `MockCluster`: topics, partitions, logs, HWM/LSO, brokers (up/down),
    groups (offsets, members, generation id), transactions (state, epoch,
    committed/aborted stamps, pending offsets), KRaft roles, re-auth
    deadlines, manual clock.
  - `FaultPolicy`: per-op / per-topic / per-group / per-txn injectable
    errors (retriable, fatal, timeout, leader-change, txn-fenced).
  - `MockProducer`, `MockConsumer`, `MockAdmin` with the same surface as
    the real clients, used by both the streams `MockStreamsDriver` and
    the core-client failure-mode tests.
  - `IdempotentState`, `BackoffPolicy`, `TelemetryCounters`,
    `ProducerStamp`.
  - Failure-mode coverage parity with selected `librdkafka` mock-cluster
    tests (0121, 0125, 0127, 0130, 0137, 0142, 0143, 0146, 0147, 0148,
    0150).

### 2.2 `wireform-kafka-streams`

- KStream DSL: filter, map, mapValues, flatMap, flatMapValues,
  selectKey, peek, branch / split, merge, repartition, through, toTable
  (KIP-523), `processValuesStream` (low-level), named variants for every
  operator (KIP-307), `printToHandle`, dynamic-topic sink
  (`TopicNameExtractor`, KIP-303).
- KTable DSL: filter, mapValues, suppress (KIP-328), join, leftJoin,
  outerJoin, transformValues, toStream, groupBy.
- GlobalKTable + global join.
- Aggregations: `count`, `reduce`, `aggregate` over KGroupedStream and
  KGroupedTable.
- Cogroup (KIP-150): multiple grouped streams of distinct value types
  feeding one aggregate.
- Windowed processing: tumbling, hopping, sliding (KIP-450), session
  windows. `TimeWindowedKStream`, `SessionWindowedKStream`.
- Joins: stream-stream, stream-table, table-table, KIP-213
  foreign-key (with subscription-token verification), windowed
  stream-stream.
- State stores:
  - `KeyValueStore` (in-memory + RocksDB-backed via
    `rocksdb-haskell-kadena`).
  - `WindowStore`, `SessionStore`, `TimestampedKeyValueStore`
    (KIP-258), `VersionedKeyValueStore` (KIP-889/KIP-960).
- Processor API: `ProcessorContext`, `Punctuator`, schedule
  wall-clock + stream-time punctuations.
- Topology:
  - `Topology`, `StreamsBuilder`, sub-topology computation by
    repartition boundary.
  - `TopologyDescription` with pretty-printer mirroring the JVM
    representation.
- `KafkaStreams` runtime (engine-only):
  - Worker pool (`numStreamThreads`), per-task processing, deterministic
    quiescence via STM.
  - `Engine` integrates with mock or real client; `MockStreamsDriver`
    hooks the engine to the in-process broker.
- Exactly-once V2 *scaffolding*: idempotent producer wired to the
  engine's commit boundaries, plus a pluggable `EOSCoordinator`
  recording-stub the runtime tests assert against. The actual
  transactional producer integration (records bracketed by
  `BeginTxn` / `EndTxn` markers; `sendOffsetsToTransaction` for
  consumer offsets) is still pending — tracked in §3.1 below.
- Standby task scaffolding (the `MockCluster` already understands
  changelog topics and warmup reads).
- `StreamsConfig` covering processing.guarantee, num.stream.threads,
  commit.interval.ms, cache.max.bytes.buffering,
  default.deserialization.exception.handler, etc.
- `StreamsMetrics`: in-process registry, counters / gauges / duration
  stats.
- Interactive Queries v1 (KIP-67) + KIP-796 typed Query API (key range,
  count, all).
- `DslStoreSuppliers` (KIP-1247) so users can swap default backends.
- `RestoreListener`-style hooks for changelog replay.

## 3. Outstanding work — gap analysis

For each item: severity (S0 = parity-blocker, S1 = important for real
production use, S2 = nice-to-have), rough invasiveness, and the test
surface that must land.

### 3.1 Core client gaps

> The S0 / S1 / S2 client-side items previously listed here have
> all landed on this branch. What remains is the integration-side
> follow-up that requires running infrastructure rather than new
> code:

#### S1 — KIP-368 SASL re-auth: mid-session handshake driver

- **What's done.** `Kafka.Network.Auth.SASL.effectiveReauthDeadlineMs`
  + `reauthRequiredAtMs` are the pure decision layer (computes the
  effective deadline + applies the safety margin).
- **What's left.** The pipeline-side machinery that actually runs
  a fresh `SaslHandshake` + `SaslAuthenticate` exchange mid-session
  without dropping in-flight requests. Touches
  `Kafka.Client.Pipeline` (it has to pause new sends, drain
  in-flight, run the handshake, resume).

#### S1 — librdkafka-shaped stats: per-counter wiring

- **What's done.** `Kafka.Telemetry.StatsJson` renders a snapshot
  matching the librdkafka shape. Mirror dashboards / collectd /
  Datadog port over without changes.
- **What's left.** A scheduled emitter inside the producer /
  consumer that polls the existing `MetricsRegistry` /
  `TelemetryCounters` on the configured `statistics.interval.ms`
  and hands the snapshot to a user callback. Additionally, the
  OTel exporter side (`Kafka.Telemetry.OpenTelemetry` is still a
  stub) is independent of the JSON path and remains pending.

### 3.2 Streams gaps

#### S0 — KafkaStreams runtime: engine ↔ NativeDriver wiring

- **What's done.** `Kafka.Streams.Runtime.NativeDriver` is the
  driver record that wires `Producer` + `Consumer` + bound
  `Transaction` against the streams engine. The pure decision
  layers for KIP-441 probing (`ProbingRebalance`) and KIP-869
  revocation grace (`RevocationGrace`) are in place. The KIP-892
  store transactional buffer (`State.Transactional`) is in place.
- **What's left.** Refactor `Kafka.Streams.Runtime` so the engine
  consumes a `StreamDriver` instead of driving the in-process
  mock directly. Cascades into `Streams/MockDriverModesSpec` and
  `Streams/EngineSpec`. The driver / store-transactional / probe
  / revocation building blocks the refactor needs are all
  present; the work is "thread the driver through".

#### S0 — Schema Registry: Avro / JSON-Schema / Protobuf payload serdes

- **What's done.** `Kafka.Streams.Serde.SchemaRegistry` ships the
  `SchemaRegistryClient` interface, an `inMemoryRegistry` for
  tests, a `mockHttpRegistry` for asserting the HTTP exchange
  shape, the Confluent magic-byte envelope, and `registrySerde`.
- **What's left.** Concrete payload serdes for Avro / JSON-Schema
  / Protobuf, plus a real HTTP-backed `SchemaRegistryClient`
  (separate from the core lib so the http-client dep stays
  optional). Compatibility-mode tests against a real registry.

#### KIP-213 foreign-key join: DSL combinator wiring [DONE]

- `Kafka.Streams.DSL.ForeignKeyJoin.foreignKeyJoinKTable` (and the
  `left` variant) is the single user-facing FK-join combinator. It
  bakes in the KIP-213 subscription-token semantics:
  every left record carries a token derived from the value's hash;
  the subscription store is keyed by foreign key with a
  `Map k SubscriptionToken` payload; the right-side processor
  verifies the live token matches the subscription token before
  emitting. The verification is redundant in a single-task
  synchronous topology (the right-side processor sees live left
  state) but is the correctness invariant for future multi-task
  wiring.
- The previous `Kafka.Streams.DSL.ForeignKeyJoinV2` "pure data
  layer" module has been removed. There is one combinator, end of
  story. The property test that lived against the pure machine
  has been ported to drive the DSL combinator directly
  (`Streams.ForeignKeyJoinDSLSpec`).

### 3.3 Cross-cutting / infrastructure

| Item                                    | Severity | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Live-broker integration test harness    | S1       | `WIREFORM_KAFKA_BROKER`-gated suite includes the new transactional spec; promoting that to CI / Docker is still pending. |
| GHC 9.10 / 9.12 build matrix            | S2       | Currently 9.6.4 only.                                                 |
| Benchmark suite (vs `librdkafka` numbers) | S2     | New `Benchmarks.StatsAndStamping` covers stats JSON + record-batch building; comparative `librdkafka` numbers still anecdotal. |
| Documentation: tutorial-grade walkthrough | --     | `TUTORIAL.md` covers mock cluster → producer → transactions → Streams DSL → KIP-892 → Schema Registry → stats JSON. |

---

## 4. Prioritisation

In approximate order:

1. **`KafkaStreams` runtime ↔ NativeDriver wiring** (S0). The
   driver record + the pure decision layers (probing rebalance,
   revocation grace) and the EOS-V3 store transactional buffer
   are all in place. The remaining work is a deep refactor of
   `Kafka.Streams.Runtime` so the engine consumes a `StreamDriver`
   rather than driving the mock directly. Cascades into the
   existing streams-test specs.
2. **KIP-368 SASL re-auth pipeline integration** (S1). Pure
   helpers are in place (`effectiveReauthDeadlineMs` /
   `reauthRequiredAtMs`); the pipeline-side machinery that runs
   the fresh handshake mid-session without dropping in-flight
   requests still has to land.
3. **Schema Registry payload serdes** (S0). Wire concrete Avro /
   JSON-Schema / Protobuf serdes on top of the existing
   `SchemaRegistryClient` + envelope helpers. HTTP-backed client
   in a separate sub-library so http-client stays optional.
4. ~~**KIP-213 FK-join DSL wiring** (S1).~~ **DONE** — the single
   `foreignKeyJoinKTable` combinator bakes in the KIP-213
   subscription-token semantics; the V2 module is now the pure
   data layer used by tests.
5. **librdkafka stats interval emitter + OTLP exporter** (S1).
   `StatsJson` ships the snapshot shape; the producer / consumer
   need a scheduled emitter that polls existing counters every
   `statistics.interval.ms`. OTLP exporter side independent.
6. **Live-broker Docker fixture + GHC 9.10 / 9.12 matrix**
   (cross-cutting). The new transactional integration spec
   already runs against `WIREFORM_KAFKA_BROKER`.

---

## 5. Test strategy

Every implementation step lands with the following tiers:

1. **Unit / property tests** in `test/Client/*Spec.hs` or
   `test/Streams/*Spec.hs`. Pure-function tests for codec, builders,
   assignors, store invariants.
2. **Mock-broker integration tests** in `test/Client/MockBroker*Spec.hs`
   or `test/Streams/Mock*Spec.hs`. Drive end-to-end flows through
   `MockCluster` with injected faults.
3. **Live-broker smoke tests** (planned), gated behind
   `-fwith-live-broker` so CI without Docker still runs.
4. **Benchmark targets** (planned) using `tasty-bench`, guarded by
   `-fwith-benchmarks`.

For each item in §3, the listed "Tests" subsection becomes the spec for
the test work; a feature isn't considered done until those tests are
landed and green.

---

## 6. Risks & open questions

- **Engine driver abstraction shape.** Class-based vs record-of-IO. The
  former is more idiomatic but harder to mock without exposing instance
  internals; the latter is simpler but uglier. Decision deferred to the
  start of the runtime-rewire work.
- **State store transactional buffer.** RocksDB's `WriteBatch` is the
  natural fit, but we'd need to thread a batch identity through every
  store operation. The in-memory implementations need a parallel
  layer.
- **Schema Registry HTTP client.** We don't currently depend on `http-client`
  or `wreq`. Picking the dep is a one-way door; pin it to `http-client` +
  `tls` since we already pull `crypton-connection`.
- **Multi-broker test ergonomics.** Spinning N `MockCluster` instances
  and joining them is currently per-test boilerplate. A shared
  `withMockEnsemble` helper would reduce friction.

---

## 7. Tracking

Outstanding work is tracked in this document, not in GitHub issues, until
the project graduates beyond personal-fork status. When an item moves
from "Outstanding" to "Done" the corresponding section in §2 grows and
its mention in §3 is deleted, with a one-line PR reference left in the
commit message.

The current snapshot of in-progress / pending work is:

- **Top of the queue:** thread the new `Kafka.Streams.Runtime.NativeDriver`
  through `Kafka.Streams.Runtime` so the engine drives the real
  `Producer` + `Consumer` (with the bound `Transaction` providing
  EOS-V2 commit boundaries) and the KIP-892 store-transactional
  buffer drains on each commit (§3.2). All the building blocks
  this refactor needs landed in this branch.
- After that, the open items are the SASL re-auth pipeline driver
  (KIP-368) and the live-broker Docker fixture for CI. None block
  the others.
