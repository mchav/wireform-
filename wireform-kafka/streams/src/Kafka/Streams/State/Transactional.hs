Module      : Kafka.Streams.State.Transactional
Description : KIP-892 EOS-V3 transactional buffer for state stores

Today the engine commits the producer transaction and the
changelog write atomically, but state-store puts happen
/before/ the transaction commit — if the commit fails after a
put, the store is left in a state inconsistent with the
broker-side log.

KIP-892 introduces a /store transaction/ layer: every put goes
into a per-task buffer first, the buffer is replayed onto the
underlying store only when the producer transaction commits
(immediately, atomically), and an abort discards the buffer.

This module provides the wrapper. It works on any
'KeyValueStore'; the buffer is a per-task in-memory
@Map@ overlay that:

  * intercepts 'kvsPut' / 'kvsPutIfAbsent' / 'kvsDelete' and
    records the change rather than applying it;
  * falls back to the underlying store on 'kvsGet' so
    /reads see writes/ within the same transaction (matches
    the JVM EOS-V3 read-your-writes property);
  * merges the buffer overlay into 'kvsRange' / 'kvsAll' /
    'kvsReverseRange' / 'kvsReverseAll' so scans also see
    in-transaction writes (extends read-your-writes from point
    lookups to iterators — caught by the
    'Streams.Properties.KVStoreSMSpec' state-machine test);
  * exposes 'commit' and 'abort' that the engine driver calls
    when the producer transaction commits / aborts.

Note: this is a /single-writer/ overlay. The engine guarantees
each task's store is written from one thread (the task's
processor); concurrent writers would need extra synchronisation.

{- | Project the transactional wrapper as a 'KeyValueStore' that
the engine can hand to processor code. Reads — both point
lookups and range\/all iterators — see /pending writes/ first;
writes are buffered.

An 'Ord' constraint on @k@ is required so the buffer overlay
can be merged into the iterator results in key order. Every
shipped backend already requires 'Ord' for its own range
semantics, so this is not an additional caller obligation in
practice.
