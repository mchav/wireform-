-- Module      : Kafka.Streams.Sources.CDC
-- Description : Change-data-capture source primitive (Riffle §5)
--
-- Most upstream Kafka Streams topologies consume from a Kafka
-- topic. Riffle adds a /source primitive/ for change-data-capture
-- (CDC) feeds, where each record is structured as
-- @Insert / Update / Delete@ with a before-image and an
-- after-image of the row. CDC sources are how Debezium, AWS DMS,
-- and direct database tail-readers publish to Kafka in practice.
--
-- This module provides:
--
--   * 'CDCEvent' — the canonical event ADT.
--   * 'CDCSource' — a record producing 'CDCEvent's that the
--     runtime can poll. The contract is similar in shape to the
--     mock consumer but is independent of the Kafka wire protocol
--     so non-Kafka transports (binlog tail, WAL stream, etc.) can
--     plug in directly.
--   * 'cdcToKTableProcessor' — wires a 'CDCSource' into a
--     materialised KTable, applying the standard CDC-to-KTable
--     mapping (Insert/Update → @put@, Delete → @delete@).
--   * 'inMemoryCDCSource' — deterministic in-process test
--     source. The chaos suite drives this.

-- | Which phase the upstream CDC connector is currently in.
-- Debezium and similar tools distinguish between the initial
-- /snapshot/ (a one-shot dump of every existing row) and the
-- /streaming/ phase (the WAL / binlog tail that captures live
-- changes). Phase transitions are surfaced to downstream
-- operators so they can:
--
--   * Defer windowing during the snapshot (the snapshot is
--     usually a flood of records with stale timestamps).
--   * Reset 'WatermarkStrategy' idleness on the transition so
--     a long snapshot doesn't trigger idle detection on the
--     downstream.
--   * Switch from \"all rows are inserts\" to
--     \"insert/update/delete\" semantics where applicable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Result of one poll on a 'CDCSource'. Records and schema

-- | A 'CDCSource' is a non-Kafka source the runtime can poll.
-- The shape extends what a mock 'Kafka.Streams.Mock.Consumer'
-- provides with CDC-specific bits: phase awareness, schema
-- changes, and the standard commit-cursor checkpointing.
--
-- The runtime calls 'cdcPoll' on each tick. An empty 'CDCPoll'
-- (no events, no schema changes) means "no new data"; the
-- runtime backs off as it would on a Kafka consumer.
-- 'cdcCommitTo' is called after a successful commit cycle; the
-- source uses this to advance its read cursor on the upstream
-- system (e.g. update a tail-reader checkpoint).
--
-- 'cdcClose' is invoked on shutdown; the source should release
-- any underlying connection / file handle.

-- | Drain one batch of events from a 'CDCSource' onto a
-- 'KeyValueStore'. Returns the count of events applied. The
-- runtime would call this from the topology's source-processor;
-- this helper makes the loop easy to test in isolation.
--

-- store — they're surfaced via 'cdcToKTableStep''s return value
-- so the caller can route them onto a side stream.

-- Key-aware compaction
----------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Compact a batch of CDC events on the way to a KTable: for
-- each key, keep only the /last/ event in source order. Drops
-- intermediate updates that would just be overwritten anyway.
-- The runtime applies this when 'cdcToKTableStep' loads a
-- materialised view because:
--
--   * Snapshot phase often produces many records per key in
--     quick succession (an initial INSERT then a series of
--     UPDATEs).
--   * Downstream subscribers only see the final state of each
--     key; intermediate updates are wasted writes.
--
-- The compactor is order-preserving: keys retain the relative
-- order of their last event; within a key, all earlier events
-- are dropped. A trailing 'CDCDelete' is preserved so the
-- KTable correctly observes deletes.
