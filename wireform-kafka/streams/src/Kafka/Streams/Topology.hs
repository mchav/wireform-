Module      : Kafka.Streams.Topology
Description : Low-level Topology builder

Mirrors @org.apache.kafka.streams.Topology@:

@
Topology t =
    emptyTopology
  & addSource    "src"  ["my-topic"] keySerde valSerde extractor
  & addProcessor "p1"   parents       processorSupplier
  & addStateStore       storeBuilder ["p1"]
  & addSink      "snk"  "out-topic"   keySerde valSerde ["p1"]
@

The topology is type-erased internally so we can keep all sources /
processors / sinks in a single map. Type information is preserved
at the edges (source serdes, sink serdes) and at the processor
supplier (which is given a typed 'ProcessorContext' inside the
runtime).

Validation:

  * names are unique across nodes
  * every parent reference resolves to a node
  * sources have at least one topic
  * the graph is acyclic
  * stores referenced by 'addStateStore' exist

{- | Mirrors @Topology.optimize(StreamsConfig)@. Applies the
requested KIP-295 optimisations and returns a (possibly)
rewritten topology.

The two rewrites are:

['optReuseSourceKTable' — @REUSE_KTABLE_SOURCE_TOPICS@]
  For every processor that has exactly one parent which is a
  single-topic 'SourceSpec' /and/ owns exactly one state store
  whose logging is enabled, mark the store's 'LoggingConfig' to
  reuse the source topic as its changelog (via
  'loggingSourceTopic'). This eliminates the separate
  @\<application-id\>-\<store-name\>-changelog@ topic the broker
  would otherwise create — the source topic itself is the
  compacted log we'd replay on restore.

  Skipped when:

    * The source has multiple topics (no single topic to reuse).
    * The processor has multiple parents (the store doesn't have
      a unique source).
    * The store is shared across multiple processors (it isn't
      owned by this lineage).
    * Logging is already disabled (no changelog to reuse).
    * Another sink in the topology writes to the source topic
      (it's not actually source-only).
    * The store is a global store (its source is already its
      changelog by construction).

['optMergeRepartitionTopics' — @MERGE_REPARTITION_TOPICS@]
  Sibling pass-through repartition processors (named
  @KSTREAM-REPARTITION-\<prefix\>-…@) that share the same
  single parent /and/ the same repartition prefix are merged
  into one. Every downstream consumer is rewired to the surviving
  node, the duplicate nodes are removed, and 'topoChildrenIndex'
  is rebuilt. The result: one shared repartition processor
  instead of N independent ones, mirroring the Java optimisation
  that collapses multiple internal repartition topics into one.

  Skipped when:

    * A repartition node has multiple parents (split lineage —
      not a sibling collision).
    * Two repartition processors share a parent but disagree on
      prefix (different broker-side topics in the JVM
      equivalent).
    * The processor owns a state store (a stateful repartition,
      which we never auto-emit but a 'liftIO_' caller could).

== Semantics

Both rewrites are observably equivalent to the un-rewritten
topology under the in-process 'TopologyTestDriver' (which
doesn't materialise broker topics — changelogs are an in-memory
store, repartition is a logical pass-through). They become
observable against a real broker, where the changelog/topic
count drops.

== Idempotence + dynamic modification

'optimizeTopology' is /reflective/: every call wipes the
optimiser's prior decisions (the 'topoChangelogPlan' map) and
re-derives them from the current graph state. This means:

  * @'optimizeTopology' cfg . 'optimizeTopology' cfg = 'optimizeTopology' cfg@
    (idempotent).
  * Subsequent modifications via 'addSink' / 'addProcessor' /
    'addSource' / 'addStateStore*' invalidate prior optimisation
    decisions; calling 'optimizeTopology' again restores
    correctness. Specifically, after adding a sink to a source
    topic that was being reused as a changelog, re-running the
    optimiser /clears/ the stale plan entry (the topic is no
    longer a clean source-only changelog).
  * 'validateChangelogPlan' (also run as part of
    'validateTopology') catches the case where the user
    modified the graph and /forgot/ to re-optimise. Stale
    entries are reported as 'StaleChangelogPlan' errors.

For 'optReuseSourceKTable' the reflective behaviour applies
cleanly: clear + re-derive on every call. For
'optMergeRepartitionTopics' the rewrite is destructive
(duplicate nodes are removed) — re-running picks up newly-added
siblings but cannot recover removed ones. See
'applyMergeRepartitionTopics' for the full contract.

User-explicit declarations via
'Kafka.Streams.State.Store.withSourceTopicChangelogKV' are
/never/ touched by the optimiser; they live in
'LoggingConfig.loggingSourceTopic' and are consulted by
'effectiveChangelogReuse' in addition to the side-table.

The rewrite is /destructive/ on the topology — losing
repartition nodes are removed entirely from 'topoProcessors',
'topoOrder', and 'topoChildrenIndex'. Subsequent modifications
are still safe and correct: re-running 'applyMergeRepartitionTopics'
(via 'optimizeTopology') on the modified graph picks up the new
state. Specifically:

  * Adding a new sibling with the same prefix gets absorbed
    into the existing survivor.
  * Adding a new sibling with a /smaller/ node name swaps the
    survivor — the new node becomes the merged target, the
    old survivor folds in.
  * Adding a sibling under a different parent leaves both
    alone (different parents = different merge group).

Unlike 'applyReuseSourceKTable', this rewrite cannot be
/reverted/ — once the duplicate nodes are gone, you'd have to
rebuild the graph from the AST to recover them. That's by
design: the merge is semantically equivalent (pass-throughs
don't observe records) and the broker resource savings are the
whole point.

The supplied store builder is realised as a regular state store,
but the 'StoreName' is /also/ added to 'topoGlobalStores'. The
runtime treats global stores as cluster-wide replicas: every
instance subscribes to the source topic and writes to the local
copy. Within the single-task 'TopologyTestDriver' the
distinction is purely semantic — the same source/processor/store
machinery handles the data flow.

The @processorSupplier@ takes (k, v) records and updates the
store; a typical implementation just does @kvsPut store k v@.
Use 'Kafka.Streams.GlobalKTable' for the high-level
"global lookup table" API; this lower-level entry point lets
you run arbitrary processor logic on the global side.
