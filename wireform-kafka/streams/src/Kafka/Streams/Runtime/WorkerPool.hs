-- Module      : Kafka.Streams.Runtime.WorkerPool
-- Description : numStreamThreads worker pool
--
-- Mirrors Java's @StreamThread@ pool: each worker owns its own
-- engine, its own slice of partitions, and a private input queue.
-- The pool fans records out to the correct worker by partition; a
-- dedicated 'async' thread per worker drains its queue and drives
-- the engine.
--
-- == Usage
--
-- @
-- pool <- newWorkerPool topo "app-id" perWorkerOwnership
-- mapM_ (submitRecord pool ...) records
-- waitForQuiescence pool
-- closeWorkerPool pool
-- @
--
-- The single-task 'TopologyTestDriver' is unchanged. The pool is a
-- separate, multi-thread-aware /driver/ used by tests and by the
-- broker-backed runtime when @numStreamThreads > 1@.
