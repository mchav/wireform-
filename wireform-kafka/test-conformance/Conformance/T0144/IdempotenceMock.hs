Module      : Conformance.T0144.IdempotenceMock
Description : librdkafka @tests\/0144-idempotence_mock.c@ (partial port)

librdkafka's @0144-idempotence_mock@ uses the in-process
@rd_kafka_mock_cluster_new@ to drive the idempotent producer's
sequence-number / producer-id machinery through a sequence of
broker-side errors, and asserts that retries do not duplicate.

We do not yet have an equivalent mock cluster (see
@docs\/LIBRDKAFKA_CONFORMANCE.md@), so the broker-side half is
out of reach for now. What we *can* port: the per-partition
sequence-number bookkeeping that the producer relies on. This is
the same state the librdkafka test ultimately exercises through
the mock; we exercise it directly through the producer's internals.
