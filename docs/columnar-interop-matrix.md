# Columnar interop matrix

What's tested against what, as of this PR. Each row is one
direction (wireform → engine, or engine → wireform); a "✓ N/M"
cell means "N of M test files in this matrix pass through the
listed engine without modification".

## Apache Parquet

|                                  | pyarrow 24 | duckdb 1.5 | polars 1.40 | arrow-rs 53 |
| -------------------------------- | :--------: | :--------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| **wireform → engine** (10 files) |  ✓ 10/10   |  ✓ 10/10   |   ✓ 10/10   |   ✓ 10/10   |
| **engine → wireform** (14 files) |  ✓ 14/14   |   ✓ 3/3    |    ✓ 3/3    |     n/a     |

The wireform → engine side covers: required Int32 / Int64 /
Float / Double / Bool / ByteArray / UTF-8, ZSTD-compressed,
two-row-group, mixed required + nullable. The engine → wireform
side covers each engine's defaults plus their preferred
codecs (Snappy / ZSTD / GZip / LZ4_RAW / dictionary / V1 page /
V2 page / multi-row-group).

## Apache ORC

|                              | pyarrow 24 | duckdb 1.5 |
| ---------------------------- | :--------: | :--------: |
| **wireform → engine** (5)    |    ✓ 5/5   |  ⚠ skipped |
| **engine → wireform** (8)    |    ✓ 8/8   |     n/a    |

DuckDB's ORC support is a community extension not bundled by
default in 1.5.x; polars doesn't ship a stable ORC reader.
pyarrow.orc wraps the official Apache C++ ORC reader so it
exercises the spec faithfully.

The reverse-direction matrix covers Snappy / ZSTD / Zlib
compression plus every primitive type our writer emits.

## Apache Iceberg

|                                                | pyiceberg 0.11 + fastavro |
| ---------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------: |
| **wireform → engine** (3 metadata files)       |          ✓ 3/3            |

The 3 files cover the three Iceberg metadata file types:

* `manifest_v2.avro` — manifest file (Avro container of
  `manifest_entry` records, full v2 statistics including
  `column_sizes`, `value_counts`, `null_value_counts`,
  `lower_bounds`, `upper_bounds`).
* `manifest_list_v2.avro` — manifest list (Avro container of
  `manifest_file` records).
* `table_metadata_v2.json` — `TableMetadata` JSON pyiceberg
  parses through `TableMetadataUtil.parse_raw`, surfacing
  `format_version`, `table_uuid`, `location`,
  `current_snapshot_id`, schemas, and snapshot list.

Reverse-direction (read pyiceberg-emitted metadata into
wireform) is the next bite-sized follow-up; the writer-side
matrix above is the higher-impact one because it validates
that wireform-emitted Iceberg tables are consumable by every
downstream Iceberg client.

## Apache Arrow IPC

|                              | pyarrow 24 | arrow-rs 58 |
| ---------------------------- | :--------: | :---------: |
| **wireform → engine** (26)   |   ✓ 26/26  |   ✓ 26/26   |

The 26 files cover every primitive integer width
(int8/16/32/64, uint8/16/32/64), Float / Double, Binary /
FixedSizeBinary, Date / Time / Timestamp / Duration,
Decimal128, List<int32>, Struct, dictionary-encoded UTF-8,
view types (Utf8View / ListView), RunEndEncoded, ZSTD body
compression, and the file-format (.arrow) variant.

ListView / LargeListView used to fail against arrow-rs 53 with
`Type ListView not supported` in `arrow-ipc/src/convert.rs`; that
gap was closed in arrow-rs by [PR
\#9006](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/9006) (merged
2025-12-18, shipped in the 57.x cycle and round-tripped through
the Parquet writer in [\#9344](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/9344)
in the 58.0 release, 2026-02-19). The interop pin is now
`arrow = "58"` and the columnar harness expects every file —
including `ours_listview.arrows` — to read clean.

(History note: `utf8view` flushed out a wireform alignment bug
arrow-rs caught — see commit "FlatBuffers / Arrow IPC: fix i64
vector alignment for arrow-rs".)

## Apache Delta Lake (table format)

|                                          | deltalake (delta-rs) |
| ---------------------------------------- | :------------------: |
| **wireform → engine** (commit JSON)      |       ✓ 3/3          |
| **wireform → engine** (checkpoint Parquet) |     ✓ 1/1          |

The wireform-delta probe opens a Delta table via
`Delta.IO.openDeltaTable`. When a `*.checkpoint.parquet`
file is present the snapshot at that version is decoded
directly via `Delta.Checkpoint.decodeCheckpointFile` (no
JSON walk through every prior commit), then JSON commits
with version > checkpoint version are replayed on top.

The Python driver builds three real Delta tables with
`deltalake.write_deltalake`:

  * an **unpartitioned** table with a write / append /
    overwrite history (only one add survives);
  * a **partitioned-by-region** table with two writes;
  * a **checkpointed** table — 12 appends + an explicit
    `DeltaTable.create_checkpoint()` at v11, then APPEND v12
    + OVERWRITE v13. This forces both code paths: the
    checkpoint Parquet seeds the snapshot at v11, then the
    post-checkpoint commits replay through the JSON walker.

For every case the probe's `version`, `active_files`,
`protocol`, `metadata.partition_columns`,
`metadata.schema_field_names`, `last_checkpoint.version`,
and `checkpoint_parquet_version` are cross-checked against
`DeltaTable.*`. For the checkpointed case the probe
additionally surfaces the *standalone* checkpoint-Parquet
snapshot (`checkpoint_active_files`, `checkpoint_protocol`,
`checkpoint_metadata`) and the driver verifies it produces
the same view of the table at v11 that the JSON walker
would.

Driver: `wireform-delta/scripts/delta_interop.py`.

## Apache Hudi (timeline)

|                                       | hudi-rs (Python)     |
| ------------------------------------- | :------------------: |
| **wireform → engine** (commit JSON)   |       ✓ 2/2          |

The wireform-hudi probe parses every completed
`<instantTime>.commit` JSON under `.hoodie/`, folds it into a
per-partition / per-fileId `FileSlice` map, and writes a JSON
summary. The Python driver hand-builds two `COPY_ON_WRITE`
tables on disk (one unpartitioned with two commits where the
second supersedes the first's base file; one partitioned by
`region` with a UPSERT in one partition), then asserts that
hudi-rs's `HudiTable.get_file_slices()` and wireform's view
agree on every `(partition_path, file_id, base_file)` tuple.

Hudi-rs is read-only — writing real Hudi tables requires
Spark / hudi-java — so the driver constructs the on-disk layout
directly. The point of the round-trip is to verify wireform's
JSON commit decoder and `tableStateFromCommits` fold produce the
same active set the canonical reader does.

Driver: `wireform-hudi/scripts/hudi_interop.py`.

## Apache Lance (file footer + dataset)

|                                       | pylance              |
| ------------------------------------- | :------------------: |
| **engine → wireform** (file footer)   |       ✓ 1/1          |
| **engine → wireform** (dataset)       |       ✓ 1/1          |

Two interop modes:

* `--file`: probe a single `.lance` data file. Emits the typed
  `LanceFooter` (CMO offset, GBO offset, num columns, num
  global buffers, version, plus the per-column /
  per-global-buffer (position, size) tables). The driver
  asserts every field matches an independent struct-unpack
  decode of the trailing 40 bytes, that `num_columns` matches
  `len(LanceDataset.schema)`, and that the column slice table
  is in-range.

* `--dataset`: probe a `.lance/` directory.
  `Lance.IO.openLanceDataset` enumerates every
  `_versions/<n>.manifest` (decoding the `2^64 − 1 − v`
  filename convention back to the user-visible version),
  parses the active manifest's distinct 16-byte
  `LanceManifestFooter`, and lists every `data/*.lance`
  fragment. The driver writes two append commits with pylance
  and asserts the probe's `latest_version`, `versions[]`,
  `latest_manifest_footer.{manifest_position, major_version,
  minor_version}`, and `data_file_names` all match what
  `lance.dataset(...).versions()` and a directory listing
  report.

Driver: `wireform-lance/scripts/lance_interop.py`.

## Bugs surfaced (and fixed) by the probes

Each one was a real bug in wireform that no internal test
exercised; the probes caught them by feeding our output into
the Apache reference readers.

1. **`utf8_required.parquet` was rejected by every reader**.
   Cause: the probe used a bare `ByteString` literal for the
   row containing `"Δοε"`. ByteString's `IsString` truncates
   each `Char` to its low 8 bits, silently mangling
   non-ASCII strings. (Probe-side bug.)
2. **Default builds couldn't read what every other engine
   writes by default.** The `snappy` / `zstd` / `lz4` Cabal
   flags were `default: False`. pyarrow defaults to Snappy,
   duckdb to Snappy, polars to ZSTD. Flipped to `default:
   True` on Parquet; added the same flags to ORC (which was
   missing snappy + zstd entirely).
3. **`ColumnMetaData.dictionary_page_offset` was wired to
   the wrong thrift field number** (10 instead of 11; field
   10 is `index_page_offset`). Result: the offset was always
   `Nothing` after decode, so `columnChunkSlice` missed the
   dictionary page and any RLE_DICTIONARY data page failed
   with "RLE_DICTIONARY page before dictionary page".
4. **Dictionary page header rejected legacy
   `PLAIN_DICTIONARY` encoding.** pyarrow's V1 writer emits
   dictionary pages with `PLAIN_DICTIONARY = 2`; both `PLAIN`
   and `PLAIN_DICTIONARY` are spec-valid for the dict page
   itself.
5. **BOOLEAN with `RLE` encoding (encoding 3) wasn't
   supported.** V2 BOOLEAN columns use this encoding;
   previously the dispatcher returned "unsupported encoding
   3".
6. **LZ4_RAW + ORC LZ4 went through a wire-incompatible
   `lz4` Hackage package.** That package framed every block
   in an 8-byte size header that no other Parquet / ORC
   reader expects. Replaced with direct FFI bindings to
   `liblz4` (`Columnar.LZ4`).
7. **ORC `StripeFooter.columns` field was always empty.**
   Every official ORC reader rejects this with "bad number
   of ColumnEncodings in StripeFooter: expected=N, actual=0".
   Fixed to emit one `ColumnEncoding` per column (DIRECT for
   Struct / Map / List / Union; DIRECT_V2 otherwise).
8. **ORC postscript magic was required to be `"ORC"`.** The
   field is optional in the spec; pyarrow / arrow-cpp omit
   it because the leading "ORC" file header is canonical.
9. **ORC footer + stripe footers weren't decompressed.** The
   spec wraps both in the file's compression envelope; we
   were reading the raw bytes and the protobuf decoder
   choked on the high-bit byte from the compressed stream.
10. **Arrow IPC `[long]` vectors had wrong element
    alignment.** The variadic-buffer-counts vector for view
    types put i64 elements at file position `≡ 4 mod 8` —
    arrow-rs's verifier rejected it. Generic `prepForObject`
    accounted for the u32 length prefix incorrectly. Fixed
    with a vector-aware `prepForVector` helper.
