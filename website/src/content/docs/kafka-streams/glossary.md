title: Glossary
description: Definitions of Kafka, Kafka Streams, Riffle, and distributed-systems terms used throughout the Kafka Streams docs.
sidebar:
  order: 99
---

Plain-English definitions of every term that shows up across the
Kafka Streams docs, plus the KIP numbers that come up by name.
Skim if you're new to streams; cross-reference if you hit a term
you don't recognise.

Pages elsewhere in this section link into the entries below by
anchor — e.g. the [Visibility page](./operating/visibility/) links
to [event time](#event-time) on first use.

---

## A

### ACID

**A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation, **D**urability —
the four classical guarantees of a SQL database transaction.
Streaming systems give you a different bundle of guarantees, and
the [Visibility versus ACID databases](./operating/visibility/)
page works through the mismatch.

### Alignment group

A Riffle concept: a set of [watermark](#watermark) sources whose
watermarks should not diverge by more than a configured bound. A
fast source whose watermark out-paces the group's slowest member
by more than `agBound` is **backpressured** — the runtime pauses
fetching from it until the slowest member catches up. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.Watermark.AlignmentGroup`.

### `applicationId`

The consumer-group identity and the prefix every internal topic
(changelog, repartition) inherits. Changing it is a fresh-start
deploy, not a rollout. See
[Topology evolution](./operating/topology-evolution/).

### Assignor

The component that decides which member of a [consumer
group](#consumer-group) owns which [partition](#partition) (and,
in Streams, which [task](#task)). The built-in default is
**cooperative-sticky**: it prefers to keep tasks on their current
owner across rebalances, and revocations are incremental rather
than stop-the-world. See also [KIP-848](#kip-848).

### Async I/O operator

A Riffle [Prim](#prim) that runs the user's `IO` action on a
bounded worker pool instead of on the [stream thread](#stream-thread).
Provides backpressure, EOS-correct offsets, ordered or unordered
output, per-request timeout / retry, and explicit failure policy.
Full walkthrough in [Enrichment via external systems](./guides/enrichment/).

### At-least-once

The default [processing guarantee](#processing-guarantee). Every
record is processed *at least once* — and therefore *possibly more
than once* on a [rebalance](#rebalance) or fault. External side
effects should be idempotent.

---

## B

### Backpressure

The mechanism by which a slow downstream stage signals an upstream
stage to slow down. In Kafka Streams the consumer poll loop is
naturally backpressured by the processor it feeds: a full inbox
blocks new fetches. In Riffle async I/O, a full in-flight queue
blocks the [stream thread](#stream-thread) on enqueue.

### Broker

A node in a Kafka cluster — the server-side process that stores
topic logs and serves produce / fetch requests. Multiple brokers
form a cluster; one is the controller (under KRaft mode) that
coordinates metadata.

---

## C

### CDC (Change Data Capture)

A pattern (and protocol family) where each row-level change in an
upstream database (insert, update, delete with before / after
images) is captured and published downstream. Debezium and AWS DMS
are the canonical implementations. Riffle's `Kafka.Streams.Sources.CDC`
ships a primitive for materialising CDC feeds into KTables with
snapshot/streaming-phase awareness and key-aware compaction.

### Changelog topic

The internal Kafka topic the framework writes a [state
store's](#state-store) updates to. On instance loss, the state is
rebuilt by replaying this topic from offset 0 (or, with [snapshot
stores](#snapshot-store), from the last snapshot's offset).
Convention: `<applicationId>-<storeName>-changelog`.

### Co-partitioning

The requirement that two topics being joined share the same
partition count and the same key partitioner, so each `(key, A)`
record and its matching `(key, B)` record land on the same task.
Streams validates co-partitioning at startup; mismatches throw
during topology validation.

### Cogroup

A Kafka Streams DSL operator that lets you aggregate multiple
input streams into one output table with a single aggregator
function per stream and a single shared store. The Haskell port is
`cogroup` / `addCogrouped` / `aggregateCogrouped` in
`Kafka.Streams.Cogroup`.

### Commit cycle

The orchestrated sequence the runtime runs every
`commitIntervalMs` (default 30 s) to make a batch of work durable.
Under EOS-V2 with Riffle 2PC sinks the six steps are:
`beginTxn → flush → commitOffsets → preCommit2PC → commitTxn →
commit2PC → storeCommit`. See `Kafka.Streams.Runtime.EOS.runCommitCycle`
and the [Exactly-once page](./operating/exactly-once/).

### Consumer group

A set of Kafka consumers sharing the same `group.id` (in Streams,
the [`applicationId`](#applicationid)) that the broker
coordinator collectively assigns partitions to. Each partition is
owned by at most one member at a time.

### Cooperative-sticky

See [Assignor](#assignor).

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

An architectural pattern in which writes go to one model
(commands) and reads come from another (queries), connected by an
asynchronous projection. Kafka Streams + downstream query store is
a natural CQRS implementation; the trade-off discussion lives in
[Visibility versus ACID databases](./operating/visibility/).

---

## D

### DLQ (Dead-letter queue)

A topic (or other sink) that receives records the runtime couldn't
process. Riffle's bounded `suppress` supports a dead-letter
overflow policy; `processing.exception.handler` (KIP-1033) supports
a DLQ disposition for records that throw.

### `DispatchMode`

The Riffle `StreamsConfig` knob that picks which
`Kafka.Streams.Runtime.WorkerPool` constructor the runtime uses.
Three values: `DispatchPartition` (parity default — explicit
per-worker partition ownership), `DispatchHashed` (parity hashing
by `(topic, partition)`), `DispatchKeyGroup` (Riffle key-group
routing). See [Scaling](./operating/scaling/).

### DSL

**D**omain-**s**pecific **l**anguage. In Kafka Streams, the
typed combinator API (`stream`, `mapValues`, `filter`, `groupBy`,
`count`, …) as opposed to the lower-level [Processor
API](#processor-api). The library exposes two DSL surfaces: the
Free-Arrow Free DSL (`Kafka.Streams.Topology.Free`) and the
imperative builder DSL (`Kafka.Streams.KStream`, etc.).

---

## E

### EOS / EOS-V2 / EOS-V3

**E**xactly-**o**nce **s**emantics. EOS-V2 (KIP-447, KIP-129) is
the transactional-producer-plus-`TxnOffsetCommit` story that
ensures records written by Streams and consumer offsets advance
atomically. EOS-V3 / KIP-892 adds transactional state stores so a
store's writes commit in lockstep with the producer transaction.
The `processingGuarantee` config selects between
`AtLeastOnceP` and `ExactlyOnceP`.

### Emit policy

Riffle generalisation of the JVM Streams `EmitStrategy`
(KIP-825). A first-class `EmitPolicy` value any windowed /
stateful operator can consume: `EmitOnUpdate`,
`EmitOnWindowClose`, `EmitOnCount n`, or `EmitCustom` with a
user predicate. Lives in `Kafka.Streams.EmitPolicy`.

### Event time

The timestamp associated with a record by its producer — when the
underlying business event happened. Contrast with [processing
time](#processing-time): the timestamp the runtime saw the record.
The pair drives all of [windowing](#window), [watermarks](#watermark),
and [grace periods](#grace-period).

### Event-time TTL

Riffle KV-store wrapper: state expires based on the [coordinated
watermark](#watermark-coordinator), not on wall-clock. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.State.KeyValue.TTL`. Pair with
`ttlClockFromCoordinator` for the coordinator-driven clock.

---

## F

### Fenced producer

A producer the broker has rejected because a newer producer with
the same `transactional.id` was observed. Surfaces as
`ProducerFencedException` / `InvalidProducerEpochException`. Almost
always means two instances are running for the same `(applicationId,
taskId)`. See the [zombie-producer
runbook](./operating/runbooks/#producer-fenced--invalid_producer_epoch).

### Foreign-key join

A KTable-KTable join keyed not on the record key but on a
caller-supplied extractor of the left value. Streams handles the
subscription-token bookkeeping. Haskell port:
`foreignKeyJoinKTable` / `leftForeignKeyJoinKTable` in
`Kafka.Streams.ForeignKeyJoin`.

### Free arrow / `FreeArrow`

A free construction over the `Arrow` typeclass: the typed DSL is
represented as a value, then interpreted / optimised / compiled at
the boundary. `Kafka.Streams.Topology.Free` builds a
`FreeArrow Prim` AST that the compiler walks. The benefit:
topologies are first-class values you can inspect, snapshot, and
optimise before they run.

---

## G

### GADT (Generalized Algebraic Data Type)

A Haskell ADT whose constructors can refine the type parameters of
the resulting value. Used by `Prim` in
`Kafka.Streams.Topology.Free` to encode the input / output types
of each operator at the type level.

### GlobalKTable

A KTable replicated in full on every instance, not partitioned
across the group. Used for small reference data (currency rates,
country lookups) where you want zero-network-cost lookups. Loaded
from a Kafka topic via `globalTable`.

### Grace period

The amount of time a [window](#window) stays open accepting late
records past its end. A 1-hour tumbling window with a 10-minute
grace closes 70 minutes after the window's start in event time.
Configured via `withGracePeriod` / `withSessionGracePeriod`.

---

## H

### Heartbeat

The periodic message a [consumer group](#consumer-group) member
sends the coordinator to confirm liveness. Under [KIP-848](#kip-848),
heartbeats also carry [subscription metadata](#subscription-metadata)
and receive [reconciliation](#reconciliation) deltas.

### Hopping window

A fixed-size [window](#window) that advances by a step smaller
than its size — adjacent windows overlap. A 5-minute hopping
window with a 1-minute advance produces a new window every minute,
each containing the last 5 minutes' worth of records.

---

## I

### Idempotent / idempotency

An operation that has the same effect when invoked multiple times
as when invoked once. `PUT /resource/42` with the same body is
idempotent; `POST /create-order` typically isn't. Critical for
external side effects under [at-least-once](#at-least-once) or for
the recovery path of a [two-phase commit sink](#two-phase-commit-sink).

### Idempotency token

A stable per-record identifier (usually the upstream `(topic,
partition, offset)` tuple) written to a [state store](#state-store)
to deduplicate side effects on [replay](#replay). The pattern: on
each record, check the store; if absent, fire the side effect,
then write the token. See [Enrichment](./guides/enrichment/#pattern-6-idempotency-tokens-in-a-state-store).

### Idle source

A [watermark](#watermark) source that hasn't produced records for
longer than its `IdleAfter` threshold. The
[coordinator](#watermark-coordinator) excludes idle sources from
the min-watermark computation so a quiet partition doesn't stall
downstream windows.

### Interactive query (IQ)

Read-only access to a live [state store](#state-store) from
outside the [stream thread](#stream-thread). Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.InteractiveQueries`. The query layer is your code;
the library exposes the typed handles + cross-instance discovery
metadata (KIP-535).

### Internal topic

A Kafka topic the framework auto-creates and owns:
[changelog](#changelog-topic) topics for state stores,
[repartition](#repartition-topic) topics for keyed shuffles. Their
names derive from the `applicationId` and the [stable
name](#stable-name) of the owning operator.

---

## J

### Join

An operator that combines records from two streams (or a stream
and a table). Five shapes: stream-stream (windowed), stream-table,
table-table, stream-[GlobalKTable](#globalktable), and [foreign-key](#foreign-key-join).

---

## K

### `KafkaStreams`

The runtime handle. `newKafkaStreams` constructs it from a
topology + config; `startKafkaStreams` runs it. `closeKafkaStreams`
drains and shuts down. Most live operations
(`setStateListener`, `addStreamThread`, `pauseKafkaStreams`, etc.)
take a `KafkaStreams` value.

### Key-group

A Riffle abstraction: a fixed routing space (default 128) into
which record keys hash, decoupling [parallelism](#parallelism)
from [partition](#partition) count. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.Runtime.KeyGroup`. See [Scaling](./operating/scaling/#key-groups-parallelism-decoupled-from-partitions).

### KGroupedStream / KGroupedTable

Intermediate types produced by `groupBy` / `groupByKey` on a
stream / table. They're the input to aggregation operators
(`count`, `reduce`, `aggregate`).

### KIP

**K**afka **I**mprovement **P**roposal — the Apache Kafka design-
review process. Specific KIPs that come up by name across these
docs:

| KIP | What |
| --- | ---- |
| **KIP-295** | `topology.optimization` config knob (reuse-source-topics, merge-repartitions, single-store-self-join) |
| **KIP-307** | Stable, deterministic processor names |
| **KIP-418** | Named branches (`Branched.*`) |
| **KIP-441** | Probing rebalance for warmup-ready standbys |
| **KIP-447** | EOS-V2 producer-per-instance with `TxnOffsetCommit` |
| **KIP-535** | Cross-instance IQ discovery (`StreamsMetadata`, `KeyQueryMetadata`) |
| **KIP-591** | `default.dsl.store` config |
| **KIP-825** | First-class `EmitStrategy` |
| **KIP-848** | Next-gen consumer-group protocol — broker-side incremental reconciliation |
| **KIP-892** | EOS-V3 transactional state stores |
| **KIP-924** | In-process `TaskAssignor` plug-in |
| **KIP-925** | Rack-aware assignment strategy |
| **KIP-1033** | First-class processing-exception handler with DLQ disposition |

### KStream

A Kafka Streams record stream: an append-only sequence of `(key,
value, timestamp, headers)` tuples. Compare with [KTable](#ktable).

### KTable

A Kafka Streams changelog stream interpreted as a key-value table:
later records overwrite earlier ones for the same key. Materialised
into a [state store](#state-store) (in-memory or RocksDB).
[GlobalKTable](#globalktable) is the fully-replicated variant.

### KRaft

Kafka's Raft-based metadata protocol that replaced ZooKeeper for
cluster coordination. The library's integration tests spin up a
KRaft-mode broker; the streams runtime is KRaft-agnostic at the
client layer.

---

## L

### Linearisable

A consistency model in which every operation appears to take
effect atomically at some point between its invocation and its
response. The Kafka Streams in-memory stores' single-key reads
are linearisable; iterators are eager snapshots, not
linearisable across mutations.

### Little's law

The relation `L = λW` — the average number of items in a system
equals the arrival rate times the average time in the system.
Used in [Enrichment](./guides/enrichment/#picking-aiobuffercapacity-and-aioworkers)
to size async-I/O worker pools: `workers ≈ throughput × latency`.

### Log compaction

A Kafka topic-level retention policy that keeps the latest value
per key indefinitely (rather than truncating by time or size).
Changelog topics use compaction so state recovery from offset 0
remains bounded by unique-key count, not by total record count.

---

## M

### `Materialized`

The DSL knob that controls which [state store](#state-store)
backend an aggregation, join, or table-source uses. Picks the
store builder and the serdes. Mirrors the JVM
`Materialized` builder.

### Member epoch / rebalance epoch

KIP-848 versioning. Member epoch bumps every time a member's
owned assignment changes; rebalance epoch bumps every time the
group-wide target changes. Stale-epoch heartbeats must reconcile
before continuing.

---

## O

### Object store

Riffle's abstraction over S3 / GCS / Azure Blob / a filesystem.
Snapshot stores write their snapshot blobs through an
`ObjectStoreClient` and read them back on recovery. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.Runtime.ObjectStore`.

### Offset

The position of a record within a [partition](#partition). The
consumer commits offsets to the broker so a restart resumes from
the right place. Under EOS, offsets advance only when the
[commit cycle](#commit-cycle) commits.

### Orphan internal topic

A [changelog](#changelog-topic) or [repartition](#repartition-topic)
topic on the broker that doesn't correspond to any store /
operator in the current topology. Usually a sign that a previous
deploy renamed something. Detected by
`Kafka.Streams.Observability.OrphanTopics.detectOrphans`. See the
[runbook](./operating/runbooks/#orphan-internal-topics-detected).

---

## P

### Parallelism

The number of concurrent units of work the runtime can run. In
parity Streams: bounded by `numStreamThreads × instances`, capped
by the source-topic [partition](#partition) count. Under Riffle
[key-groups](#key-group): bounded by `kgcTotal` (default 128),
independent of partition count.

### Partition

A subset of a Kafka topic's data, distributed across brokers and
consumed in parallel. Records with the same key always land on the
same partition (under the default partitioner). The partition is
the unit of consumer-group assignment.

### Pipeline

A `newtype` in `Kafka.Streams.Pipeline` wrapping `a -> IO b` with
`Category`, `Arrow`, `ArrowChoice`, `Functor`, and `Applicative`
instances. Used to build reusable, named topology fragments that
compose with `(>>>)`. The `ArrowChoice` instance gives you the
[ROP](#railway-oriented-programming) `(+++)` / `(|||)` combinators
over `Either`.

### Pre-commit drain

Riffle hook (`ProcessorContext.ctxRegisterPreCommitDrain`) that
lets an async operator block the [commit cycle](#commit-cycle)
until its in-flight queue is empty. Used by `asyncMapValues` etc.
to make offset commits EOS-correct.

### `Prim`

The GADT constructor type in `Kafka.Streams.Topology.Free` that
represents one operator in the typed AST. Every DSL combinator
(`mapValues`, `filter`, `groupBy`, …) corresponds to a `Prim`.

### Probing rebalance

The cadence at which the runtime re-issues a rebalance to promote
[standby](#standby-task) tasks that are within
`acceptableRecoveryLag`. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.Runtime.ProbingRebalance`. Default cadence: 10
minutes (`probingRebalanceIntervalMs`).

### Processing guarantee

`AtLeastOnceP` vs `ExactlyOnceP` in `StreamsConfig.processingGuarantee`.
Determines whether the producer is transactional, whether offsets
commit through `TxnOffsetCommit`, and whether state stores use the
transactional buffer. See [EOS](#eos--eos-v2--eos-v3).

### Processing time

The wall-clock time the runtime saw a record. Contrast with
[event time](#event-time).

### Processor API

The lower-level Kafka Streams API: write a `Processor` /
`FixedKeyProcessor` directly with `process` + `init` callbacks,
access state stores by name, schedule [punctuators](#punctuator).
The DSL ultimately compiles to processor-API calls.

### Punctuator

A scheduled callback inside a processor. Two clocks:
`WallClockTimePunctuation` (every N ms of real time) and
`StreamTimePunctuation` (every N ms of [event time](#event-time)
advance). Used for time-driven emits, idle-window detection,
cache eviction.

---

## R

### Rebalance

The process by which a [consumer group](#consumer-group)
reassigns partition / [task](#task) ownership across its members
in response to a membership change. Under the classic protocol it
was stop-the-world; under [KIP-848](#kip-848) it's incremental
per-task with no double-ownership at any point.

### Reconciliation

KIP-848 term for the diff between a member's currently-owned
assignment and its target assignment. `Reconciliation` carries
`rAdd` and `rRemove` sets; a losing member acknowledges its
`rRemove` before the gaining member sees the task in `rAdd`.
Defined in `Kafka.Streams.Runtime.RebalanceProtocol`.

### Remote KV

A Riffle KV-store backend with no local state — every get / put
is a network call against a remote store (FoundationDB / TiKV /
DynamoDB shape). Node restart is a metadata operation. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.State.KeyValue.Remote`.

### Repartition

The operation of re-keying a stream and re-publishing it to an
internal topic so downstream stateful operators see records
co-partitioned. Performed by `repartition` / `through` /
implicit auto-insert (`optAutoInsertRepartition`).

### Repartition topic

The [internal topic](#internal-topic) a `repartition` operator
writes to. Convention: `<applicationId>-<nodeName>-repartition`.

### Replay

Re-processing records the runtime already saw, after a fault or
[rebalance](#rebalance) rewinds the consumer to a prior committed
[offset](#offset). Under [at-least-once](#at-least-once) this is
the normal recovery path; under EOS it still happens but the
duplicate output is aborted.

### Railway-oriented programming

A pattern, popularised by Scott Wlaschin's F# write-up, for
modelling pipelines of fallible operations as two parallel
tracks: a success track and a failure track. Each stage either
advances the value on the success track or routes it to the
failure track; failure short-circuits all downstream success
stages cleanly. Kafka Streams' `DeserializationHandler` /
`ProcessingExceptionHandler` / `ProductionHandler` /
`AsyncFailurePolicy` / `SinkOutcome` are all track-switch
surfaces; the [`Pipeline`](#pipeline) newtype's `ArrowChoice`
instance is the explicit ROP combinator set. Full mapping in
[Railway-oriented programming with streams](../concepts/railway-oriented-programming/).

### `runCommitCycle`

The orchestrator function in `Kafka.Streams.Runtime.EOS` that
drives one [commit cycle](#commit-cycle). Takes an `EOSCoordinator`
+ a flush body + a getter for offsets-to-commit; returns
`CommitSucceeded` / `CommitAborted` / `CommitFatal`.

---

## S

### Schema Registry

Confluent's per-subject schema-versioning service. The library's
serdes (`Kafka.Streams.Serde.Avro`, `Kafka.Streams.Serde.JsonSchema`,
`Kafka.Streams.Serde.Protobuf`) speak the Confluent envelope and
the `registrySerdeChecked` wrapper enforces compatibility-mode
checks at construction time.

### `SchemaVersioned` store

Riffle KV-store wrapper that tags every write with a
`SchemaVersion` and migrates reads forward through a chain of
`SchemaMigration` callbacks. `burnInMigrate` rewrites older
entries in-place with resumable progress. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.State.KeyValue.SchemaVersioned`.

### `SinkTxnId`

The Riffle identifier for one in-flight transaction on a
[two-phase commit sink](#two-phase-commit-sink). Made stable
across restarts (typically `applicationId-instanceId-cycleCounter`)
so recovery can correlate prepared txns with their producer
counterparts.

### Snapshot store

A Riffle KV-store backend that incrementally writes snapshots of
its state to an [object store](#object-store). Recovery time
becomes `O(time-since-last-snapshot)` rather than `O(state-size)`.
Lives in `Kafka.Streams.State.KeyValue.Snapshot`.

### Stable name

A deterministic, build-stable name for an operator node. Mirrors
the JVM's KIP-307 generator: `KSTREAM-MAPVALUES-0000000007`. The
name is part of the deployment contract because [internal
topics](#internal-topic) inherit from it. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.Topology.StableNames`.

### Standby task

A warm replica of an active [task's](#task) state, maintained by
tailing the active's [changelog](#changelog-topic). Promotion on
instance loss becomes metadata-only if the standby is within
`acceptableRecoveryLag`. Riffle's `SnapshotPointer` mode lets a
standby hold only `(snapshotId, advancedTo)` rather than a full
replica.

### State store

The persistent (or in-memory) key-value, window, or session store
attached to a stateful operator. Backends: in-memory + RocksDB
(via `+rocksdb`); Riffle adds snapshot, tiered, remote, and
versioned variants. Read-only IQ access via
`Kafka.Streams.InteractiveQueries`.

### `StreamsConfig`

The top-level runtime configuration record. Mirrors the Java
`StreamsConfig` properties. Defined in `Kafka.Streams.Config`.

### `StreamsMetadata`

KIP-535 record: what each instance in the group looks like to its
peers (host:port, owned partitions per store, standby partitions
per store). Used by an external IQ proxy to route key-level queries
to the right host.

### `StreamTime`

The per-task event-time clock — running max of extracted
timestamps on records this task has seen. Replaced by the
[coordinated watermark](#watermark-coordinator) where Riffle
opts in.

### Stream thread

The OS thread that drives one consumer + N workers in this
runtime. (Different from the JVM Streams "one stream thread per
consumer" model — see the README for the comparison.) The thread
that runs user-supplied processor code; nothing in user code
should block it for long.

### Subscription metadata

Bytes a [consumer group](#consumer-group) member attaches to its
JoinGroup request. Streams uses it to advertise
[`application.server`](#streamsmetadata), owned standby tasks,
and the assignor's per-member state.

### Suppress

The DSL operator that holds emissions back until a condition is
met — typically "until window closes" or "until time limit
expires". Riffle adds a bounded variant with explicit
`BufferOverflowPolicy` (`DropOldestSilently`, `ShutdownWhenFull`,
`suppressWindowedShed` to DLQ).

---

## T

### Task

The unit of [parallelism](#parallelism). One task owns one
partition of one subtopology + its local [state stores](#state-store).
`TaskId` identifies a `(subtopology, partition)` pair.

### `TaskAssignor`

KIP-924 in-process plug-in for the leader-side assignment path.
Replaces the built-in cooperative-sticky assignor. The runtime
constructs an `ApplicationState` from the live view and invokes
`taAssign`.

### Tiered KV

A Riffle KV-store backend with a hot tier (local in-memory or
RocksDB) + a cold tier (S3 / GCS). Reads probe hot, fall through
to cold, and promote. Eviction decides which entries demote when
the hot tier exceeds its budget. Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.State.KeyValue.Tiered`.

### `Topology`

The compiled, validated graph the runtime executes. Built from the
DSL value of type `Topology Void o` (or directly via the
imperative `Kafka.Streams.Topology` builder). Validated by
`validateTopology` before the runtime starts.

### `TopicNameExtractor`

KIP-303 sink-side dynamic-topic-name extractor. Lets one sink
route records to different topics based on the record. The library
exposes it via `toExtracted` + `TopicNameExtractor`. Useful when
you want "dynamic topology" without actually mutating the
compiled topology.

### Transactional producer

A Kafka producer with a `transactional.id` that supports
`beginTransaction` / `commitTransaction` / `abortTransaction` /
`sendOffsetsToTransaction`. The foundation of [EOS-V2](#eos--eos-v2--eos-v3).

### Tumbling window

A fixed-size, non-overlapping [window](#window). A 5-minute
tumbling window produces a new window every 5 minutes; each record
belongs to exactly one window.

### Two-phase commit sink

A Riffle [sink](#sink) interface that commits external-system
writes atomically with the Kafka [commit cycle](#commit-cycle).
Five operations: `tpsStage` (per-record buffer), `tpsPrepare`
(promote batch to "prepared"), `tpsCommit` (atomically make
visible), `tpsAbort` (discard), `tpsRecover` (resolve half-
committed txns on restart). Lives in
`Kafka.Streams.Sinks.TwoPhase`.

---

## W

### WAL (Write-ahead log)

A durable log of intended changes written before the changes are
applied to the underlying store. Under Riffle [snapshot
stores](#snapshot-store) the [changelog topic](#changelog-topic) is
the WAL between snapshots — not the sole source of truth.

### Watermark

A [timestamp](#event-time) that the runtime guarantees no later
record will arrive before. Lets downstream operators decide when
a window can close, when state can be expired, when a stream-
stream join's window is finalised. Derived from a
`WatermarkGenerator` (`MonotonicTimestamps`, `BoundedOutOfOrderness`,
`CustomGenerator`).

### Watermark coordinator

The Riffle per-`StreamsApp` component that aggregates per-source
watermarks into the effective watermark (= min of live, non-idle
sources), handles [idle-source](#idle-source) detection, and
enforces [alignment-group](#alignment-group) backpressure. Lives
in `Kafka.Streams.Watermark`.

### Window

A bounded slice of [event time](#event-time) over which a
stateful operator aggregates. Four shapes: [tumbling](#tumbling-window),
[hopping](#hopping-window), sliding, and session. Each has its own
builder in `Kafka.Streams.Window`.

## Glossary maintenance

If a term appears in the docs and isn't defined here, add it.
Prefer one-paragraph definitions; link out to deeper coverage
rather than restating it.
