A Postgres `SELECT` after an `INSERT … COMMIT` returns the inserted
row. A Kafka Streams interactive query after a state-store `put`
might or might not return the new value, depending on whether the
write has been forwarded to the read path, whether the commit cycle
has fired, whether you're querying the right instance, and (under
EOS) whether the producer transaction committed yet. None of those
caveats are bugs. They follow directly from a system that uses an
append-only log as its source of truth and rebuilds derived state
asynchronously.

This page maps each ACID property onto wireform-kafka-streams so you
know which guarantees you get for free and which require explicit
work.

## A vs. ACID

| ACID property | Kafka Streams analogue |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Atomicity | Per-record processing is atomic on a single task; per-commit-cycle atomicity is the unit of EOS |
| Consistency | "Consistency" in the streaming sense is **eventual** — derived state catches up to the log |
| Isolation | Read-uncommitted by default; read-committed with `isolation.level = read_committed` on consumers; transactional state stores buffer writes until commit |
| Durability | The Kafka log is durable; derived state is durable only after the changelog flush |

The five operationally-interesting differences are: the **commit
boundary**, the **read path freshness**, the **multi-instance
distribution**, the **event-time vs processing-time distinction**,
and the **replay-on-failure** model.

## 1. The commit boundary

In a SQL database, the commit boundary is the `COMMIT` statement.
Reads after that point see the write.

In Kafka Streams the commit boundary is **`commitIntervalMs`** (or
sooner if the cache fills). Between commits:

- The producer has accumulated records in its transactional batch.
- The state store has buffered writes in its in-memory cache and
  (under EOS) in its transactional buffer.
- The consumer's position has moved forward but the offset commit
  hasn't fired.

A downstream consumer with `isolation.level = read_committed` sees
nothing from this batch until the commit. A downstream consumer
with `read_uncommitted` sees records as the producer writes them,
including records that may be aborted later — exactly the semantics
of a database `READ UNCOMMITTED`.

Within the stream thread itself, a processor that writes to a
state store then reads from it does see its own write
immediately. This is read-your-writes-within-task. It does **not**
extend to cross-task reads even within the same process.

### Why this matters operationally

- A 30 s `commitIntervalMs` (default) means downstream
  `read_committed` consumers see records with up to 30 s of
  staleness. If your downstream service has tight SLAs, shorten
  the interval or accept the staleness budget.
- Interactive queries (`Kafka.Streams.InteractiveQueries`) read
  from the **uncommitted** view of the state store by default —
  see "Read path freshness" below for why.

## 2. Read path freshness

Interactive queries hit `Data.IORef.IORef`-backed maps for the
in-memory stores and the persistent shadow map for RocksDB.
Writes go through `atomicModifyIORef'`; reads through `readIORef`.
The semantics:

- **Linearisable** reads at the moment the `readIORef` runs. A
  query thread sees a consistent snapshot of the map.
- **Eager** iterators (`queryRange` / `queryAll`): the iterator is
  materialised at iterator-creation time. Writes that arrive
  during iteration are not visible.

What you don't get:

- **Read-after-write across stream thread and query thread.**
  A processor's `put` is in the store immediately, but a query
  thread observing it depends on the IORef's atomic-update
  ordering. In practice the visibility is microseconds, but it's
  not a contract.
- **Read-committed semantics under EOS.** The transactional store
  buffers writes until `storeCommit` fires (after the producer
  txn commits). An IQ that reads through the underlying store
  during the cycle sees the pre-commit value; an IQ that reads
  through the transactional overlay sees the buffered value. The
  default `queryKVStore` exposes the underlying store — i.e.
  committed-only reads.

If you need **strict** committed-only semantics for IQ, query
through the transactional overlay's `getCommitted` only after
confirming `commitTotal` has advanced since your last commit
observation.

If you need **fresh** reads including in-flight writes, accept the
EOS abort risk: the value you read might be rolled back on the
next cycle abort. Most external query consumers can tolerate this
because their freshness budget is wider than the commit cadence.

## 3. Multi-instance distribution

A SQL database is a logical singleton — you connect to it, you
read whatever the latest committed value is, regardless of which
backend was the writer.

A Kafka Streams state store is **partitioned and replicated**. A
key lives on exactly one instance's active task; standbys hold a
warm replica. A query for that key must route to the active
instance.

The routing primitives:

- `Kafka.Streams.Discovery.StreamsMetadata` advertises per-instance
  ownership.
- `Kafka.Streams.Discovery.KeyQueryMetadata` answers "for this
  (store, key), which instance is the active and which are the
  standbys".
- `Kafka.Streams.Discovery.HostInfo` is the `host:port` an instance
  advertises via `application.server`.

A query against the wrong instance returns `StoreNotFound`. There
is no automatic redirect within the library — the query proxy is
your code.

### Standby reads

A standby's state lags the active by up to `acceptableRecoveryLag`
records. Reading from a standby gives you:

- **Lower contention** with the stream thread on the active.
- **Stale data** bounded by lag.

Whether that trade-off is worth it depends on the use case. Read
queries that are part of a user-visible request flow usually go to
the active; bulk analytical scans usually go to standbys.

The library doesn't enforce a routing policy — you decide.
`KeyQueryMetadata.standbyHosts` returns every standby for a key;
pick by your own policy (round-robin, latency-aware, freshness-
preferring).

### Rebalance-window unavailability

During a rebalance, the partition (and therefore its state) is in
flux. KIP-848's incremental reconciliation guarantees no
double-ownership but does mean there's a window where the task is
owned by no member. IQ during that window returns either
`StoreNotFound` or a stale read from a standby.

A robust query layer handles this:

```
on IQ:
  fetch StreamsMetadata
  route to KeyQueryMetadata.activeHost
  on StoreNotFound or rebalance-error:
    fall back to KeyQueryMetadata.standbyHosts in order
    if all fail:
      backoff + refresh metadata
      retry up to N times
```

## 4. Event-time vs processing-time

A SQL `INSERT` has one timestamp: when the row was inserted. A
Kafka record has two: the **event time** (when the underlying
business event happened, carried in the record's timestamp or
embedded in its value) and the **processing time** (when the
runtime saw the record).

This is the single biggest mental shift coming from databases. A
windowed aggregation is defined over event time. A late record
(event time before the current `StreamTime`) lands in a window
that may already have closed, depending on `withGracePeriod`. The
result is **correct** in event-time terms but **surprising** to a
caller who expected processing-time semantics.

The pieces:

| Concept | Where it lives |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Record timestamp extraction | `TimestampExtractor` family in `Kafka.Streams.Time` |
| Per-task event-time clock | `engineStreamTime` — running max of extracted timestamps on this task |
| Cross-source coordination | `Kafka.Streams.Watermark.WatermarkCoordinator` |
| Window grace period | `withGracePeriod` / `withSessionGracePeriod` on window builders |
| Out-of-order handling | `BoundedOutOfOrderness` watermark generator |
| Idle-source handling | `IdleAfter` in `IdlenessConfig` |

### Why per-task StreamTime is not enough

The Phase-1 `engineStreamTime` is the running max of extracted
timestamps on **this task**. A topology that joins two streams
whose source partitions are consumed by different tasks must wait
for the laggard, but per-task `StreamTime` doesn't know about the
laggard. Three failure modes:

1. **Idle source stall.** One partition stops receiving records;
   its `StreamTime` stops advancing; a downstream window stalls
   waiting for it.
2. **Cross-source skew.** Source A is at event time `t`; source B
   is at `t + 1h`. A join's window expiry uses one side's
   `StreamTime` and misses or admits records depending on which
   side fires first.
3. **Replay race.** During a rebalance the new owner's
   `StreamTime` starts at zero until the first record arrives.

The Riffle `WatermarkCoordinator` fixes all three by computing the
**effective watermark = min of live, non-idle sources**, and by
optionally backpressuring fast sources via alignment groups. See
the [Watermark concept page](../concepts/watermarks/) (TODO) and
`Kafka.Streams.Watermark` for the API.

### Operational reading: don't conflate the two clocks

- A dashboard showing "records per second" is processing-time.
- A windowed aggregate emitting `windowEnd` is event-time.
- The two diverge during catch-up after an outage: processing rate
  is high (catching up), event time is also moving fast (replaying
  old records), but neither is wall-clock.

`punctuateTotal` on the wall-clock punctuator and on the
stream-time punctuator are different metrics. The wall-clock one
tells you "scheduled effects fired"; the stream-time one tells you
"event time advanced past this trigger". A wall-clock punctuator
that fires at the expected rate while the stream-time one is
stalled is a sign that an idle source is holding back event time.

## 5. Replay-on-failure

A SQL transaction either commits or doesn't. There is no scenario
in which a row is committed twice.

Kafka Streams **may replay records on failure**:

- At-least-once: any unrecoverable error rewinds the consumer to
  the last committed offset and replays from there. Side effects
  in `peek` / `foreach` / `mapValuesM` happen again.
- Exactly-once-V2: the producer transaction either commits or
  aborts atomically. State-store writes drain in step with the
  producer commit. **External side effects that aren't inside a
  two-phase-commit sink replay on abort.**

This is the right model for a streaming pipeline — the alternative
is dropping records on partial failure — but it has consequences
for code that thinks in database terms:

- **No "commit-then-act" pattern.** You cannot "commit, then call
  the external API knowing the commit is durable" because the
  commit boundary is implicit and the runtime can rewind.
- **Idempotency is non-negotiable for external side effects.**
  Either the side effect is naturally idempotent (a PUT to a
  versioned URL, an UPSERT keyed on a stable id) or you make it
  idempotent (token in a state store, 2PC sink).
- **`PROCESSING_GUARANTEE = AT_LEAST_ONCE` is the default**, and
  it does what it says: every record is processed *at least
  once*, which means *possibly more than once*. Plan for it.

## A worked comparison

The user-facing question "did this transfer go through?" mapped to
both worlds:

### Postgres

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO transfers (id, amount, status) VALUES (?, ?, 'pending');
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?;
UPDATE transfers SET status = 'complete' WHERE id = ?;
COMMIT;

-- Then:
SELECT status FROM transfers WHERE id = ?;
-- → 'complete'. Guaranteed.
```

### Kafka Streams (EOS)

```
[transfers topic] → process → updates [accounts changelog] + [transfers-out topic]
                                                                  ↓
                              [external read service] ← IQ ← [transfers-out KTable]
```

A read on `[transfers-out KTable]` for the transfer id may return:

- The current value, if the commit cycle has fired since the
  record was processed.
- The previous value (or "not found"), if processing happened but
  the commit cycle hasn't fired yet.
- The previous value, if a rebalance is in flight and the active
  is mid-transfer.
- Inconsistent values across instances during a brief rebalance
  window.

For "did the transfer go through?" semantics you typically:

1. Process the transfer atomically in Streams.
2. Sink the final state to a downstream system the user reads
   from — Postgres, a key-value store, or a separate IQ-fronted
   service.
3. The downstream system is the source of truth for the user's
   read; it just lags Kafka by a bounded amount.

This is the same architectural pattern as CQRS — and the same
trade-off. You give up read-your-writes in exchange for unlimited
horizontal write throughput, replayability, and the ability to
materialise the same source data into many downstream views.

## Mental-model tips

- **Treat the Kafka log as the source of truth.** Everything else
  is a materialised view.
- **Treat the commit cycle as the consistency boundary.** Within
  a cycle, things are in flux; between cycles, things are
  durable.
- **Don't expect a query to see what a write-then-read pair would
  return.** Use IQ as a *debugger* or as a *bounded-staleness
  cache*, not as a replacement for a query layer.
- **Event time and processing time are different clocks.** Pick
  one per concern and stick with it.
- **For external-system effects, design idempotently or use 2PC.**
