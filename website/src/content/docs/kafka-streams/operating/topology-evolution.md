title: Topology evolution and rolling deploys
description: How a new version of your binary interacts with state stores, changelog topics, repartition topics, the consumer group, and your peers during a rolling deploy.

Your topology is part of the deployment contract. The internal Kafka topics the framework creates for you depend on operator names — and those names depend on the shape of your code. Get the rolling-deploy story wrong and you'll leak topics on the broker, lose state on rebalance, or strand running tasks.

This page is the operating manual for a binary rollout where the topology might change between versions.

:::tip[Unfamiliar terms?]
Kafka, Streams, and Riffle terminology is defined in the [Glossary](../glossary/).

:::note[TL;DR]
- Five kinds of topology diff each have a different operational story; the table below classifies them.
- Name every stateful operator explicitly (`Named` + `materializedAs`) — auto-generated names shift when you reshuffle the topology, which renames their changelog topics.
- Run the [topology-JSON golden-file diff](../observability/#topology-json) in CI and the [orphan-topic detector](../observability/#orphan-internal-topics) on startup.
- Set `numStandbyReplicas` to at least 1 for any non-trivial state, otherwise rebalance means a full changelog replay.
- KIP-848 makes the rebalance itself incremental — no double-ownership at any point during a transfer.

## What a "topology change" actually means

There is no single answer to "did my topology change". There are five
overlapping diffs, and each one has a different operational story.

| Diff | Example | Stops processing? | Loses state? | Leaks topics? |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Inserted a `peek` or `foreach` | Adding a log line | No | No | No |
| Renamed an internal node | Removed a `Named` annotation | No | **Sometimes** | **Yes** |
| Added a new operator with a new store | New `count` aggregation | No (new store warms from changelog) | No | No |
| Removed an operator with a store | Deleted a `groupBy`+`count` | No | The removed store's data is gone; its changelog becomes an orphan | **Yes** |
| Changed the key, value, or window of an existing store | Switched `Materialized` value serde | **Yes (must migrate)** | **Yes if you don't migrate** | Possibly |

The rest of this page expands each row.

## Stable names are the deployment contract

Every operator in your topology gets a name. `Kafka.Streams.Topology.StableNames`
(KIP-307) generates that name deterministically based on (a) the
operator class and (b) the order in which operators were added to the
builder. A generated name looks like `KSTREAM-MAPVALUES-0000000007`.

The framework derives **internal topic names** from operator names
and the `applicationId`. The convention is:

- Changelog: `<applicationId>-<storeName>-changelog`
- Repartition: `<applicationId>-<nodeName>-repartition`

See `Kafka.Streams.Observability.OrphanTopics.changelogTopic` and
`Kafka.Streams.Observability.OrphanTopics.repartitionTopic` for the
exact derivation.

**If the name changes, the broker creates a new internal topic and
abandons the old one.** The old changelog topic doesn't disappear; it
sits on the broker and silently consumes disk forever, while the new
store starts from empty and warms via the new changelog.

Two real-world ways to accidentally change names:

1. **Inserting an operator earlier in the chain.** Because the
   generator's counter is per-`OperatorClass`-and-per-topology, adding
   a `MapValues` upstream of an existing one renumbers every
   subsequent `MapValues`. If any of those downstream nodes own a
   store with logging enabled, you just renamed its changelog.
2. **Removing or changing a `Named`.** Explicit `Named "my-aggregator"`
   pins the name across builds. Removing it lets the auto-generator
   take over and pick a different number.

### How to defend against name drift

**Rule one: name everything that owns state.** Every operator that
produces a stateful store should pass an explicit `Named` value with
a stable, version-independent string. Same for any `repartition` /
`through` operator (those create repartition topics). Anything else
can stay auto-generated; you may rename a `mapValues` freely.

**Rule two: use the orphan-topic detector in CI and on startup.**
`Kafka.Streams.Observability.OrphanTopics.detectOrphans` is a pure
function:

```haskell
detectOrphans
  :: Topology
  -> Text              -- applicationId
  -> [TopicName]       -- topics the broker reports
  -> [OrphanInternalTopic]
```

In CI, compare against the previous topology's expected set
(`expectedInternalTopics` returns it). On startup, hand the runtime
an `AdminClient.listTopics` result and log any orphans:

```haskell
expected <- pure (expectedInternalTopics topo appId)
broker   <- AdminClient.listTopics admin
forM_ (detectOrphans topo appId broker) $ \o ->
  warn ("orphan internal topic: " <> unTopicName (orphanTopic o))
```

The detector does **not** delete anything. Auto-deletion of orphans
is a foot-gun: a misconfigured rollout (wrong `applicationId`, two
overlapping deploys) would happily nuke live state. Make it a manual,
audited operator action.

**Rule three: run a topology-shape diff in CI.** The
`Kafka.Streams.Observability.Topology.topologyDescription` function
emits a versioned JSON document. Snapshot it into your repo as a
golden file. Any PR that changes the topology will surface the diff
explicitly:

```haskell
import qualified Data.Aeson.Encode.Pretty as P
import qualified Kafka.Streams.Observability.Topology as Obs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  topo <- buildTopologyFrom topology
  BL.writeFile "topology.golden.json"
    (P.encodePretty (Obs.topologyDescription topo))
```

A diff that touches `sources`, `stores`, or `edges` is a deploy you
have to think about. A diff that only touches `processors` (renumbered
unnamed nodes) is harmless **only if** none of the renumbered nodes
own state.

## The five diff types in detail

### 1. Inserting a pure stateless operator

Adding `peek`, `foreach`, `mapValues`, `filter`, etc. in the middle of
a chain — provided neither the operator nor anything downstream of it
owns state — is the easiest case. The framework will renumber the
following auto-generated names, but no internal topic depends on them.
Roll out normally.

### 2. Renaming an internal node

If the renamed node owns a store with `loggingEnabled` (the default
for `count`, `reduce`, `aggregate`, and most `Materialized` builders),
the changelog topic name moves. Procedure:

1. **Don't do this casually.** Pin the name with `Named` on the
   first version and avoid renaming.
2. If you must rename, deploy in two stages:
   - Stage 1: keep the old node + name; add the new node with a new
     name and a `peek`/`foreach` that copies records to the new
     pipeline. Both nodes write to their respective changelogs.
   - Stage 2: once you're satisfied the new node has warmed and
     matches the old, remove the old one. The old changelog is now
     an orphan; resolve it via the orphan-topic procedure.

This is the same migration pattern as a database column rename:
double-write, verify, cut over, decommission the old column.

### 3. Adding a new operator with a new store

Roll out normally. The new instance discovers the new store at
startup, fetches it from the (empty or replayed) changelog, and
starts serving. With the Riffle snapshot backend
(`Kafka.Streams.State.KeyValue.Snapshot`) the cold-start time is
bounded by `time-since-last-snapshot` rather than store size, so a
large materialised KTable doesn't gate the rollout.

The interesting case is when the new store needs to be **populated
from scratch on rollout** (e.g. you added a new `aggregate` whose
input is a topic that has been live for months). The store will
replay the input from `earliest` or `latest` depending on the
`Consumed.AutoOffsetReset` of the source. Plan for the warmup
period; new queries against the store will see partial state until
warmup completes.

### 4. Removing an operator with a store

The store's local files are removable; `cleanUp` (the Haskell port of
`KafkaStreams.cleanUp()`) wipes them on next start. The changelog
topic on the broker is **not** removable by the runtime — it lives
on. Treat it as an orphan and resolve via the procedure in
[Observability](./observability/#orphan-internal-topics).

### 5. Changing the key, value, or window of an existing store

This is a **breaking change**. The existing changelog encodes records
under the old serde / window definition; the new code can't read
them. Three options:

| Strategy | When to use |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Schema evolution within the same serde** (e.g. add an optional Avro field) | Both versions can still deserialize each other |
| **`SchemaVersioned` store** | You want the runtime to migrate reads forward and (optionally) burn-in writes |
| **Rename + double-write** | Schema is irreconcilable; treat as case (2) |

For the second option, `Kafka.Streams.State.KeyValue.SchemaVersioned`
wraps any `KeyValueStore` and tags every write with the current
`SchemaVersion`. Reads of older versions are migrated through a
`SchemaMigration` chain you supply. `burnInMigrate` rewrites older
entries onto the current version with resumable `BurnInProgress`. The
canonical use is "v3 of my topology reads what v1 wrote and is happy
about it".

## The consumer-group side of a rolling deploy

The runtime joins a Kafka consumer group keyed on `applicationId`.
Each new instance is a new group member; rebalances happen
incrementally under the **[KIP-848](../glossary/#kip) next-gen protocol** (see
`Kafka.Streams.Runtime.RebalanceProtocol`). The rules:

- A task is never simultaneously owned by two members. If member A is
  losing task T and member B is gaining it, A's heartbeat first
  surfaces T in its `rRemove` set, A acknowledges by dropping T from
  its `currentlyOwned`, then B sees T in its `rAdd`. This is the
  reconciler in `Kafka.Streams.Runtime.RebalanceProtocol.reconcile`.
- [Standby tasks](../glossary/#standby-task) (`StandbyTask`, `StandbyDriver`) keep a warm replica
  of every active task's state. During a rolling deploy, the standby
  catches up to within `acceptableRecoveryLag` records of the active,
  and at promotion time the rebalance is **metadata-only** for any
  standby that's caught up — no changelog replay needed.
- **Probing rebalances** (`Kafka.Streams.Runtime.ProbingRebalance`)
  fire every `probingRebalanceIntervalMs` (default 10 minutes) when
  warmups are within `acceptableRecoveryLag`. That's the cadence at
  which a freshly-promoted standby can take over from a still-active
  instance during a rollout.

### Standby is the difference between a tolerable deploy and a bad one

If `numStandbyReplicas = 0` (the default), each task's state lives on
exactly one instance. When that instance drains, the next instance to
inherit the task replays the **entire** changelog from offset 0 (or
from the last snapshot, with the Riffle snapshot backend) before
serving. For a 1 TB store on a 100 MB/s replay, that is ~3 hours of
blackhole on any active query against that task.

Set `numStandbyReplicas` to **at least 1** on any non-trivial state.
For zero-downtime rollouts on critical workloads, set it to 2 so the
standby itself has a standby. Trade-off is 2× / 3× state storage and
the matching changelog write multiplier.

### Suggested rollout shape

For a topology that owns meaningful state:

1. **Pre-flight (on the operator's machine):**
   - Build v2 locally.
   - Run the topology-shape golden-diff test.
   - Run the orphan-topic detector against the live broker (using
     read-only AdminClient credentials).
   - If either reports drift you didn't intend, fix the diff before
     deploying.
2. **Deploy v2 to one instance.**
3. **Wait for the new instance to reach `StreamsRunning`**
   (`streamsStatus`). With snapshots and standby tasks, this is
   metadata-only; without, it is bounded by changelog replay time.
4. **Confirm assignment.** `metadataForLocalThreads` reports owned
   partitions; verify the rebalance went where you expected.
5. **Roll the rest of the fleet** one instance at a time, waiting
   for `StreamsRunning` between each. If you batch the rollout,
   you may invalidate every warm standby simultaneously, which
   undoes the whole point of having standbys.
6. **Post-rollout, re-run the orphan detector and clean up any
   leaked internal topics** via a manual broker AdminClient delete.

## Multi-instance with no state

If your topology owns no state (it is pure `map` / `filter` / `merge`
/ sinks), the only deploy concern is normal Kafka consumer-group
behaviour: a brief pause while the group reconciles, no replay, no
warmup. You can roll as aggressively as the broker tolerates.

## Cleaning up local state on the instance

`Kafka.Streams.Runtime.cleanUp` wipes the local store directory and
re-fetches everything from the changelog (or the snapshot) on next
start. Use it when:

- A node was offline long enough that incremental warmup is slower
  than a fresh fetch.
- You suspect local store corruption.
- You're decommissioning the instance and don't want stray state
  on disk.

`cleanUp` does **not** touch broker-side topics. The runtime owns the
local directory; the broker owns the changelog. Auto-deletion of
broker topics on `cleanUp` would be a foot-gun for the same reasons
as auto-deleting orphans.

## Multi-version coexistence during the rollout window

For the duration of a rolling deploy you have v1 and v2 instances in
the same consumer group. Three things to be aware of:

1. **Subscription-metadata compatibility.** Both versions must agree
   on the subscription-metadata format they exchange via JoinGroup.
   The default in this library matches the JVM Streams 4.0 format;
   changing the assignor (`taskAssignor` in `StreamsConfig`) without
   also rolling out the matching assignor on every instance is a
   compatibility break. Use the `upgradeFrom` knob if you ever need
   to do this.
2. **Operator shape drift.** If v1 expects record value `{a, b}` and
   v2 produces `{a, b, c}`, every v1-owned task that consumes those
   records must tolerate the extra field. This is the standard
   schema-evolution discipline — backwards-and-forwards compatibility
   on the wire serdes, especially when you're using Schema Registry.
3. **[Processing-guarantee](../glossary/#processing-guarantee) mismatch.** Switching `processingGuarantee`
   between `AtLeastOnceP` and `ExactlyOnceP` mid-rollout is **not**
   safe. Drain v1 first, then bring up v2 with the new guarantee.
   Otherwise v1 instances are committing offsets outside the
   transactional cycle and v2 instances inside it; the consumer group
   will see inconsistent commit semantics.

## What to put in your release checklist

- [ ] Topology JSON golden-diff has been reviewed.
- [ ] Orphan-topic detector reports nothing unexpected against the
      live broker.
- [ ] `numStandbyReplicas >= 1` for every state-bearing instance, or
      you have explicitly accepted the cold-start penalty for this
      rollout.
- [ ] `applicationId` is unchanged. (Changing it is a fresh-start
      deploy, not a rollout. Be sure you mean it.)
- [ ] `processingGuarantee` is unchanged.
- [ ] If you renamed a stateful operator, you have a corresponding
      cleanup plan for the old changelog.
- [ ] If you changed a store's serde, you either use
      `SchemaVersioned` or you've performed a double-write migration.
