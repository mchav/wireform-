[Apache Fory](https://fory.apache.org/) (formerly Fury) for Haskell.
Encode and decode the dynamic [`Fory.Value`](src/Fory/Value.hs), derive
typeclass instances generically or via Template Haskell, and stay
byte-for-byte wire-compatible with `pyfory` 0.17 across the implemented
type set (verified by an opt-in
[interop test suite](test-interop/Main.hs) against a real `pyfory`
process).

Fory is Apache's cross-language serialization framework. It targets
the same niche as protobuf, MessagePack, and Avro, but with a focus on
xlang structural types: a `NAMED_STRUCT` written in Java should
deserialize verbatim in Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript, or Haskell. The
wire format covers `null`, `bool`, every signed and unsigned integer
width with both fixed and varint encodings, IEEE 754 floats, length-
or NUL-terminated strings (with LATIN-1 / UTF-8 selection), binary,
chunked `LIST` / `SET` (with reference tracking), chunked `MAP`,
`NAMED_STRUCT` with a 4-byte fingerprint hash, primitive arrays, and
the five MetaString encodings (LowerSpecial, LowerUpperDigitSpecial,
FirstToLowerSpecial, AllToLowerSpecial, UTF-8) with MurmurHash3 hashes
for strings over 16 bytes.

This package is part of the [wireform](https://github.com/iand675/wireform-)
monorepo and shares its allocation primitives, annotation deriver, and
testing discipline with every other format.

## Install

```cabal
build-depends:
  base,
  wireform-fory,
  wireform-derive,    -- only if you want the cross-format annotation deriver
```

The package is part of the [wireform](https://github.com/iand675/wireform-)
monorepo. Clone the repo and `cabal build wireform-fory` to compile
locally. Compiling with the LLVM backend (`-fllvm`) adds compile time
but measurably improves runtime performance.

## Hello world

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies #-}

import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Data.Text (Text)
import Fory.Class (ToFory, FromFory, encodeFory, decodeFory)

data Order = Order
  { orderId   :: !Int
  , orderItem :: !Text
  , orderQty  :: !Int
  } deriving stock (Show, Eq, Generic)
    deriving anyclass (ToFory, FromFory)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let o     = Order 42 "widget" 3
      bytes = encodeFory o
  case decodeFory bytes of
    Right (decoded :: Order) -> print decoded
    Left  err                -> putStrLn err
```

## Encode and decode

The typeclass entry points are the usual shape:

```haskell
encodeFory :: ToFory   a => a          -> ByteString
decodeFory :: FromFory a => ByteString -> Either String a
```

For dynamic values without a Haskell type to mirror them, work with
[`Fory.Value`](src/Fory/Value.hs) directly. The `Value` ADT carries
every implemented Fory type, including chunked collections with
`TRACKING_REF` flag, primitive arrays, and `NAMED_STRUCT` envelopes
with their fingerprint hash.

`Fory.Options` controls the encoder / decoder behavior:

```haskell
import qualified Fory.Options as O

let opts = O.defaultEncodeOptions { O.eoRefTracking = True }
```

Reference tracking detects structural sharing in `Hashable`-keyed
graphs and emits Fory `REF` shortcuts; the decoder reconstructs the
shared substructures. Off by default to match the most common
cross-language encoder configuration.

## Annotation-driven deriving

`Fory.Derive` consumes the cross-format `Wireform.Derive.Modifier`
vocabulary from [`wireform-derive`](../wireform-derive/README.md). The
field renaming Fory expects (camelCase by default in pyfory) lines up
with the `renameStyle CamelCase` annotation:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

import qualified Fory.Derive          as DFory
import qualified Wireform.Derive.Aeson as DAeson
import Wireform.Derive (renameStyle, CamelCase)

data Person = Person
  { personFullName :: !Text
  , personAge      :: !Word32
  } deriving stock (Show, Eq, Generic)

{-# ANN type Person ("Person" :: String) #-}
{-# ANN personFullName (renameStyle CamelCase) #-}
{-# ANN personAge      (renameStyle CamelCase) #-}

DFory.deriveFory  ''Person
DAeson.deriveJSON ''Person
```

The deriver also registers a `Fory.Struct.StructSchema` for the type
on the side, which is what pyfory needs to materialize the
`NAMED_STRUCT` payload back into its own struct type. Both sides see
the same fingerprint hash and the same canonical field order.

## Cross-language interop with `pyfory`

The `wireform-fory-interop` test suite (behind the `+python-interop`
Cabal flag) shells out to a real `pyfory` install and verifies that
every implemented type round-trips byte-for-byte:

```bash
pip install pyfory==0.17.*
cabal test wireform-fory:wireform-fory-interop -fpython-interop
```

Current status: 45 / 45 implemented cases passing. The remaining gap
is `NAMED_COMPATIBLE_STRUCT` (Fory's schema-evolution variant, with a
bit-packed `TypeDef` field-info layout). The in-package
`CompatibleStructVal` round-trips fine inside wireform-fory; only
cross-language interop for it is unfinished.

A Hedgehog-driven fuzzer (`wireform-fory-interop-fuzz`) generates
random `Value`s and asks pyfory to deserialize them, surfacing any
case where the wire format diverges:

```bash
cabal test wireform-fory:wireform-fory-interop-fuzz -fpython-interop
```

## Testing

The per-format suite (Hedgehog + HUnit) lives in `test/`:

```bash
cabal test wireform-fory:wireform-fory-test
```

It covers the dynamic `Value` ADT, the encoder / decoder, MetaString
interop edge cases, and the spec extensions for each implemented type.

## Benchmarks

A criterion harness in [`bench/Bench.hs`](bench/Bench.hs):

```bash
cabal bench wireform-fory:wireform-fory-bench
```

For cross-language comparisons:

- Java: [Apache Fory's reference Java implementation](https://github.com/apache/fory).
- Python: [pyfory](https://pypi.org/project/pyfory/) (the same
  binding the interop test shells out to).
- Rust: Apache Fory ships an in-repo Rust binding under the same
  monorepo.

> Numbers TBD: drop a results table in once the harness is captured.
